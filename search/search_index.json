Each major component of Islandora runs in its own container. Docker : used to build ISLE - Docker is used to create containers (similar to virtual servers) based on pre-built images. A \"recipe\" file called docker-compose.yml orchestrates the setting up and networking of the containers. Dockerfile : Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile . A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession. Docker for Mac : Docker for Mac is an easy-to-install desktop app for building, debugging and testing Dockerized apps on a Mac. Docker for Mac is a complete development environment deeply integrated with the MacOS Hypervisor framework, networking and filesystem Dockerhub : website / repository that provides access to the latest Docker images for the ISLE containers. Host Server : Also called \"the host\" - this is the base computer upon which the entire ISLE stack is built - this can be a virtual machine on a laptop (LOCAL), or a server you connected to via ssh (REMOTE). Images : Docker images - source for the containers - these are built with installed software and updated by ISLE developers and stored on Dockerhub. You can see what software is used in each of the image's Dockerfiles e.g. apache/Dockerfile etc. This will contain additional information on official Docker images used as a Docker base image ISLE on GitHub : the ISLE repository on github.com contains documentation and configuration files necessary to build ISLE. Network refers to a defined Docker network that is controlled by docker. This has powerful implications in production. ISLE services: fedora , solr , apache , mysql , and proxy communicate using an internal private stack network. The service proxy also joins an insecure network that is accessible to the WAN (or for testing \"WAN\" likely means a smaller internal network). Why two networks? Swarms, scaling, replicating. Volume a Docker controlled place to hold data on the local file system. Used to persist data across containers. Documentation / Development CLI / cli - A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface[1] and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell. Git - A free and open source distributed software version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. https://git-scm.com/ The ISLE project and its documentation is hosted by an online git service called Github.com Git branches - Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax http://kirkstrobeck.github.io/whatismarkdown.com/ https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/ TL;DR - \"Too long; didn't read.\" - used to indicate a large post, article etc. that has a brief summary of said post, article etc. as it might be too long to read. YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (e.g. debugging output) or transmitted (e.g. document headers). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML http://yaml.org/ Solr Please note: Online versions of the SOLR documentation are for 6.6+ or higher, ISLE currently users version 4.10.4 only. Solr - an open source enterprise search platform with the such features as full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features[1] and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance. Learn more about Solr here Learn more about using Solr 4.10.4 Core - In Solr, the term core is used to refer to a single index and associated transaction log and configuration files (including the solrconfig.xml and Schema files, among others). Your Solr installation can have multiple cores if needed, which allows you to index data with different structures in the same server, and maintain more control over how your data is presented to different audiences. schema.xml - Solr organizes its data into documents, which consist of fields. The schema.xml file contains information about these fields, how they are analyzed and then filtered during searches. Different field types can contain different types of data so Solr uses the schema.xml file to determine how to build indexes from these input documents, and how to perform index and query time processing. solr.xml - The solr.xml file specifies configuration options for each Solr core, including configuration options for multiple cores. The file also contains mappings for request URLs, and indicates which cores to load when the server starts. solrconfig.xml - The solrconfig.xml file is the configuration file with the most parameters affecting Solr itself. In solrconfig.xml, you configure important features such as: request handlers, which process the requests to Solr, such as requests to add documents to the index or requests to return results for a query listeners processes that \"listen\" for particular query-related events. Listeners can be used to trigger the execution of special code, such as invoking some common queries to warm-up caches and much more... stopwords.txt - The stopwords.txt file is a configuration file that lists the words to be used by the Solr stop filter to be excluded from appearing or being used for searches. Examples of these common words are a large list that can include \"a\", \"the\", or \"is\" which in a page could easily appear hundreds of times or more. When a user performs a search, an algorithm calculates the relevancy of any document in the search index by counting the number of times a word appears in the text being searched and since words like \"the\" have no bearing on a document's actual relevancy; they are then excluded from this ranking algorithm's results. Systems cronjob - The software utility cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration Learn more here . This is used by such utilities like tmpreaper and the Drupal site on the apache container. domain - A domain name is your website name for the IP address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of numbers. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. Learn more about domains here or here dhparam - A script to create this file can be found in the /config/isle-newsite-sample/proxy/config/ssl-certs directory. This file is used in conjunction with the nginx reverse proxy on the proxy container to further secure the communication / traffic between the external network (ISLE Host) and the internal ISLE network (other four containers.) The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is an alternative to RSA-based key exchange using an ephemeral but slower Diffie-Hellman algorithm which generates session keys in such a way that only the two parties involved in the communication can obtain them. No one else can, even if they have access to the server's private key. After the session is complete, and both parties destroy the session keys, the only way to decrypt the communication is to break the session keys themselves. This protocol feature is known as Forward Secrecy. Learn more about Diffie-Hellman parameters environment - An ISLE environment can be a production, development or staging environment. However ISLE is flexible and can be named anything using any convention of the enduser's desire, one is not forced to do the following. Following a recommended workflow of \"code up, data down\" for Islandora development typically: a production ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all production (final and tested) potentially public facing code, themes, databases and a full amount of collection data or objects. a staging ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all running all pre-production (final and tested) private (non-public) facing code, themes, databases and a full amount of collection data or objects. staging should be an exact mirror of production (RAM, CPU, storage etc) with the exception of new code to be reviewed and tested internally prior to pushing to production. a development ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all development (experimental and untested) private (non-public) facing code, themes, databases and a limited amount of collection data or objects. development should not be a mirror of production and can be greatly limited and underpowered in its resource footprint e.g. less RAM, CPU, HD etc. Root User - the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root, root user and the superuser. Learn more about root user SSH - is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users. Learn more about SSH SSL certificates - files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization\u2019s web domain (URL). When installed on a web server, it can display a green padlock and https appears in the browser path which allow secure connections from a web server to a user's browser. Typically, SSL certificates are used to secure credit card transactions, data transfer and logins, and more.

Within the ISLE project there is a vagrant folder. Vagrantfile : Vagrantfile used to describe the type of virtual machine required for the ISLE project, and how to configure and provision these virtual machines. Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is Vagrantfile. Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project which allows endusers to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are used primarily for use on local workstations and laptops running a Ubuntu or CentOS ISLE Host server.

You do not need to specify a password to secure your key in development; in production you must protect your keys with strong passwords. Hit the Enter / Return key at all of the prompts. There should be no need to enter a file name. (However some users may find when prompted they may need to enter: id_rsa ) Do not enter a passphrase when asked twice, simply hit the Enter / Return key and move on. Example Output ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 4096 -C \"ISLE Islandora\" -f /home/islandora/.ssh/ Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.

Check if your laptop / workstation has existing ssh keys. If you do not know, use the Create ssh keys on enduser's laptop / workstation (optional) section below before advancing to Part 2 . If you already have existing SSH keys, move onto the Setup SSH access for islandora user on VM / server (Part 2) section. (optional) Create ssh keys on enduser's laptop / workstation Some endusers may or may not have created local SSH keys on their laptop or workstation prior to the next step. Please use the instructions below if this is the case. Creating ssh keys on MacOS High Sierra Creating ssh keys on Windows 10 Creating ssh keys on Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 Step 4b: Setup SSH access for islandora user on VM / server (Part 2) If you would like to login to the host machine using key-pairs, continued from (Part 1) . Copy in the existing ssh key from the enduser's laptop /workstation. This is entirely dependent on the local computer being used to connect to the Islandora server. In some cases, cloud hosting based servers e.g. Google Cloud Platform may have different requirements. This will allow key based ssh access for the enduser. Enduser's laptop /workstation running MacOS example : * Open a terminal and enter: `cat /Users/enduser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` & copy the key to the clipboard. (_On the enduser laptop not the VM_) Enduser's laptop /workstation running Windows example : Open the Command Prompt application and enter notepad C:\\Users\\enduser\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub & copy the key to the clipboard. ( On the enduser laptop not the VM ) Enduser's laptop /workstation running Ubuntu Desktop example : * Open a terminal and enter: `cat /home/enduser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` & copy the key to the clipboard. (_On the enduser laptop not the VM_) For all OS types, copy and paste this value exactly into the /home/islandora/.ssh/authorized_keys file using the nano tool on the CentOS VM ( On the CentOS VM not the enduser laptop ) nano /home/islandora/.ssh/authorized_keys Hit the Cntrl key and then the o key to write to the file. Hi the Cntrl key and then the x key to exit the file. Exit out of the ssh session from the host server as the root user exit ssh back in as islandora to test if that process worked. Example ssh islandora@isle-host-server.com -or- ssh islandora@10.10.10.130 (optional) Note for Vagrant and local VM users only For local VM and Vagrant users only, not steps to follow in a production environment Should the enduser have difficulty adding the .ssh key for the islandora user or if the enduser doesn't even have a local id_rsa.pub file, that step above can be avoided. Simply continue to access the local ISLE Host VM via opening a terminal on the enduser laptop or workstation. cd /pathto/ISLE/vagrant/ vagrant ssh sudo su su islandora This process will switch one to islandora with out having to use a password. Step 5: Create Docker group Open a terminal and ssh back into the CentOS Host Server/VM as the islandora user and become root again. sudo su Create the Docker group.

Follow this guide to spin up and install ISLE utilizing the built-in isle.localdomain domain name for review and testing. This Test/Demo ISLE guide creates an Islandora environment ( isle.localdomain ) that includes an un-themed Drupal website and empty Fedora repository for endusers to develop code, test ingests, test metadata, update fields in SOLR indexing and otherwise \"kick the tires\" on ISLE prior for further usages e.g. creating a new ISLE production site or migrating a current Islandora production site to ISLE. This checklist will attempt to point out most of the usage challenges or pitfalls. For additional help, please post a message to the Islandora ISLE Google group . Please note: There is a Glossary with relevant terms to help guide installation. Assumptions / Prerequisites This test site guide is designed for a local laptop / workstation that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the Test/Demo ISLE section of the guide . Instructions below assume a MacOS or Linux laptop or workstation. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed. Process overview Edit /etc/hosts on local laptop or desktop to allow user to easily connect to ISLE test system Test site launch process Run install script on Apache container Test the site Sample object ingestion Troubleshooting Step 0: edit /etc/hosts on local laptop or desktop It is important to add isle.localdomain admin.isle.localdomain portainer.isle.localdomain to your /etc/hosts file, as connecting directly to an IP address can prevent some components from working properly. Instructions for editing hosts files can be found here . After completing the appropriate steps, please return to this guide and continue with Step 1: Test site Launch process below. Step 1: Test site launch process In terminal (shell) or PowerShell navigate to your ISLE project directory. You may already be in this directory if you are coming from the Software Requirements Guide . The following steps below are for all users ( Vagrant, VM, non Vagrant and Docker for MacOS, Windows and Ubuntu Desktop users alike. ) The install times stated below for each container are highly dependent on the enduser's available Internet bandwidth and could take more or less time accordingly. Within the open terminal, run: docker-compose up -d This is going to download and start all ISLE Docker images ( roughly 6 GB of data so it may take a little while depending on your Internet connection ) To check if the containers are running: docker ps (shows only running containers) If you don't see all containers try: docker ps -a (shows all containers running or not) If all containers are NOT running, then proceed to the Troubleshooting section first before advancing to the \"Install script on Apache container\" section below Step 2: Run install script on Apache container Total build process may take up to 15 - 45 minutes ( depending on system and internet speeds ) Run the following install site script on the apache container by copying and pasting this command: docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh` For Windows Users only You may be prompted by Windows to: Share the C drive with Docker. Click okay or allow Enter your username and password Allow vpnkit.exe to communicate with the network. Click Okay or Allow to accept the default selection. If the process seems to halt, check the taskbar for background windows. This script will take some time (see estimate above.) You should see a lot of green [ok] messages. If the script appears to pause and prompt for y/n, do not enter any values; the script will answer for you. Wait until \"Drush script finished! ...exiting\" before proceeding.** Step 4: Testing the site Test (QC) the resulting setup by opening a web browser to the isle.localdomain URL of the new ISLE sample site (i.e. https://isle.localdomain ) and logging in. Upon entering https://isle.localdomain within a browser, you will see a SSL error warning that the site is unsafe. It is safe, it simply uses \"self-signed\" SSL certs. Ignore the error and proceed to the site. To log in to the Islandora Drupal Site: Username: isle Password: isle There is additional information for users and passwords that can be found on the Test Site Resources page. Step 5: Sample objects for ingest Courtesy of the Islandora Collaboration Group there is a sample set of objects and corresponding metadata that can be used for ingest. More information can be found on the Test Site Resources page. Post Ingest Search Tip After ingesting content, you will need to add an Islandora Simple Search block to the Drupal structure. The default search box that appears on install will only search Drupal content, not Islandora content. Structure Menu > Blocks Scroll down to find \"Islandora Simple Search\". Use dropdown to set to Sidebar Second. Save Blocks on the bottom of the page This process will now allow you to search for ingested objects that have been indexed by SOLR. Note The Proxy Control Panel is available at admin.isle.localdomain . No username/password are required. This is unsafe for production environments. Portainer (a Docker control panel) is available at portainer.isle.localdomain . No username/password are required. This is unsafe for production environments. WARNING Please always use the https://isle.localdomain domain to view the site, login etc Do not use an IP e.g. https://10.10.10.130 or https://127.0.0.01 to view the Drupal site, login etc as some components won't work e.g. Large Images using the OpenSeadragon Viewer. Troubleshooting Port Conflicts If you encounter an error like this: Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:xxxx failed: port is already allocated then ISLE may have encountered a conflict with the xxxx port identified in the error message. In MacOS, this can frequently be caused by a local Apache or Nginx web server, or local MySQL server. You may need to remove or disable these local web servers before you can successfully install ISLE. If you have a local Apache web server that ships with most MacOS machines may conflict with port 80, and can usually be disabled from a terminal using these commands: sudo apachectl stop sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist 2>/dev/null If you have a local Nginx web server it may conflict with port 8080, and it can usually be disabled from a terminal using: sudo nginx -s stop Once your web server(s) have been disabled, resume the ISLE install process by repeating your last installation command, presumably docker-compose up -d . Non-running Containers If you don't see all containers running, then stop the running containers with docker-compose down -d and start the containers one at a time following the instructions below: MySQL image pull & container launch docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:1.1 docker-compose up -d mysql Fedora image pull & container launch docker pull islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:1.1 docker-compose up -d fedora (Optional but recommended troubleshooting step) Please note the Tomcat service requires about one to three minutes to startup and as such if the enduser rushes to the URL supplied below, the service page maytime out or be reported as unreachable. Give it a little time. After spinning up fedora container, check if the Fedora service is running prior to advancing. Navigate to http://hostip:8081/manager/html a popup login prompt should appear. Enter the user name of admin and the password of isle_admin Upon login a large display of running Tomcat applications should display, scroll down to fedora The application state / status should be true If false appears instead, attempt to restart the fedora service manually. Select the restart button to the right of the status area. If it still fails, review the mounted fedora logs. The docker-compose.yml file will indicate where the logs are located. Using terminal and then entering a command like tail -n 300 - <path to ISLE project/data/fedora/log/tomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/logs/fedora.log should display enough information to troubleshoot or restart the entire startup process.

( Please work with the appropriate internal IT resource to provision these files for your domain ) OR use the Let's Encrypt guide to generate SSL Certificates. Overview The .env and tomcat.env files (also known as your \"Docker Environment files\") are your primary resources for customizing your ISLE stack. As a result your .env files contain passwords and usernames and must be treated with the utmost care. Never share or post your .env files publicly. Docker Environment Files: There are .env files that exist in your cloned copy of the repository. This section describes what these files do, and their importance to your stack! Chiefly these files are tasked with automatically configuring and setting all ISLE systems to work together in the stack. ISLE removes the need of editing the more complex config files that are part of the Islandora stack manually. Just .env it! You should edit these files with unique users/passwords, your domain name, site-name, etc. for your own unique instance of ISLE to come alive. Edit the file: .env and tomcat.env before you up ( docker-compose up ) REMEMBER: never share or post your complete .env publicly... EVER! Use caution, and when in doubt ask a maintainer for help (i.e., discuss or share the file privately with an ISLE Maintainer) Master Section: * COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME to something unique (e.g. `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle-production-collections`) * This variable is appended to Docker objects like: volume names, network names. * BASE_DOMAIN to your domainname (e.g. `BASE_DOMAIN=digital-collections.example.edu`) * This variable specifies your domain name! * CONTAINER_SHORT_ID to something unique (e.g. `CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=prod`). * This variable is appended to the end of all running containers, keep it _short_! Database Section: .env Variable Purpose ISLE Services updated What it does MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD Set the root password for MySQL MySQL, Fedora, Apache Allows Fedora and Apache to update their relevant databases as well as to configure themselves to work together. FEDORA_DB Set the name of Fedora database MySQL, Fedora Specifies which database to create or use for Fedora data. DRUPAL_DB Set the name of the Drupal database MySQL, Apache, Fedora Specifies which database to create or use for Fedora data.

FEDORA_DB_PASS DRUPAL_DB_PASS Sets MySQL user passwords MySQl, Apache, Fedora Specifies passwords of Database users. Islandora (DRUPAL) Section: .env Variable Purpose ISLE Services updated What it does DRUPAL_SITE_NAME Sets the Drupal Site Name variable Drupal Sets the name of your Islandora Website; e.g.: \" Digital Collections\" DRUPAL_ADMIN_USER Set the name of Drupal admin Drupal Specifies the 'admin user' for your Islandora website. DRUPAL_ADMIN_PASS Set the password of Drupal admin Drupal Specifies the password of 'admin user' for your Islandora website. DRUPAL_ADMIN_EMAIL Set the email of Drupal admin Drupal Specifies the email address of the 'admin user' for your Islandora site. DRUPAL_HASH_SALT Secures your installation by hashing data Drupal Secures your install of Drupal (Islandora) by hashing (obscuring) key data. Use password generator tool to create a HASH_SALT, remember alphanumeric characters ONLY (no special characters). Fedora Repository Section: .env Variable Purpose ISLE Services updated What it does FEDORA_ADMIN_USER Set the name of Fedora admin Fedora Sets the master administrator username to login to the Fedora repository. You login with this user. FEDORA_ADMIN_PASS Set the password of Fedora admin Fedora Sets the master administrator password to login to the Fedora repository. FEDORA_GSEARCH_USER Sets the username for FGS Fedora, Fedora Generic Search Sets the Fedora Generic Search (FGS) username used to login to the Fedora repository. FGS uses this user to connect to Fedora to update your search index.

TOMCAT_MANAGER_PASS Fedora, Solr, ImageServices Set the manager password to login to the admin panel. Config Directory The config directory has many purposes like holding customized configuration files mounted to specific containers (which we have no covered here), but for a single simple site we only use it to hold our proxy configs and as a place to store our SSL Certificate and Key. Proxy directory If need be, please refer to the Systems section of the Glossary for relevant terms to help guide installation. The proxy subdirectory contains all specific configurations necessary for the Traefik proxy to function properly with your changes. If need be, please refer to the SSL certificate section of the Glossary for relevant terms to help guide installation. There are also additional links for the enduser to learn how to combine the SSL Certificate File with any available SSL Certificate Chain File for the proxy process to work properly. If you followed the Let's Encrypt configuration guide, you can skip to the next section: Spin up ISLE containers Copy your SSL certificates for the ISLE Proxy into config/proxy/ssl-certs . They will and should have different names than the examples provided below. There can only be 2 files involved in this process. 1 x SSL Certificate Key File e.g. newsite-sample-key.pem This file is required. Please also note that the file extensions can also be: .key or .pem 1 x SSL Certificate File e.g. newsite-sample.pem This file is required. Please also note that the file extensions can also be: .cer , .crt or .pem Edit the config/proxy/traefik.toml file: Change line 27 and 28: certFile = \"/certs/newsite-sample.cert\" ## Change to reflect your CERT, CRT, or PEM keyFile = \"/certs/newsite-sample-key.key\" ## Change to reflect your KEY, or PEM.

ISLE removes the need of editing the more complex config files that are part of the Islandora stack manually. Just .env it! You should edit these files with unique users/passwords, your domain name, site-name, etc. for your own unique instance of ISLE to come alive. Edit the file: .env and tomcat.env before you up ( docker-compose up ) REMEMBER: never share or post your complete .env publicly... EVER!

Laverne's college archive runs an Islandora site on a server in the college IT data center. The site was installed and set up by a colleague who has since left. Some components are outdated and the work of maintaining the server and software stack is taking up a lot of Laverne's time. She's decided to try migrating the site to a new one built with ISLE. She begins by requesting a second server from IT - based on the [System_Requirements]. IT prefers not to give clients root-level access so they agree to make Laverne a user called islandora according to the [Host_Server_Setup] instructions and provide her with the SSH login instructions. The new server has attached storage large enough to hold a copy of the existing Fedora data store from the old server. Additionally, Laverne requests a new URL for the ISLE-based Islandora site \"https://digital.university-college.edu\" and ensures that IT has created DNS records so that this URL directs to the new server. Once she has access to the server and has installed the necessary software including the ISLE repository files from GitHub [Host_Server_Setup], Larverne is ready for the step-by-step [Migration_Guide]. She begins by creating a place-holder directory in the new server for all the existing Islandora site data - and copying that data over from the old server using the [migration_export_checklist] as a guide. This data will be left in the place-holder directory as a backup during the coming migration process. Laverne now creates the permanent directory structure for ISLE to use in customizing the Islandora install and re-copies the data into this structure from the place-holder directory. Since this is merely a test, she's going to skip the process of setting up an institutional Git Repository for her customization files and move on to the merge section of the guide. Working through the [migration_merge_checklist], Laverne ensures that the directories and files listed have been copied into the ISLE directory structure created above. As specified in the checklist, some of these files are slightly different in her current production Islandora. For example, the and that they have been compared to (and in some cases merged by hand) with the stock up-to-date versions of these files that come with ISLE. This turns out to be the most complex part of the entire migration process and Laverne reaches out to the [ISLE_Group_List] for assistance with a couple of the configuration files that had been edited in the past by the colleague who set up the original Islandora system. Finally, she makes the necessary edits to the docker-compose.yml file to add the necessary connection specific information. This is where she will insert the new Url and IP addresses along with a number of other site-specific customizations [migration_docker_compose_checklist]. Now she can enter the commands from the [Migration_Guide] to download the container images from Dockerhub and start them according to the instructions. After the Fedora container is up and running, Laverne follows the steps to test that all is well and sees a running Tomcat server w/ a list of running applications including fedora and Fedoragsearch.

Please Note: Ubuntu / Debian style paths are used for all examples file locations below, endusers might have different locations for these files HOWEVER the file and directory names etc should be roughly the same. Caution : While the ISLE Project recommends use of export methods or tools such as rsync, scp etc., it assumes that endusers are familiar with them and are aware of possible dangers of improperly exporting or copying production data. Ensure adequate backups of any production system(s) are made prior to any attempts. If you are not familiar or are uncomfortable with these processes, it is highly advisable to work with an appropriate IT resource. Finally also please note: Instructions from this checklist and the Migration Installation Guide may call for you to COPY data from your running Islandora environment to a newly created folder: current_prod_islandora_config located on your ISLE Host Server or local workstation called local ISLE config laptop . You will then work from this copy for future steps. In some cases, you'll need to copy configurations down to your laptop / workstation ( local ISLE config laptop ) and merge contents as directed. ( if necessary ) In other cases, due to the size of the data e.g. Fedora data you may only be able to copy production data to the target ISLE Host server ( Remote ISLE Host server ) instead of your local laptop. Contents of the production Islandora Apache html directory should be copied to a new directory called yourdomain-data/apache/html/ on your remote ISLE host server in the appropriate storage area. Contents of the production Islandora Fedora data directory should be copied to a new directory called yourdomain-data/fedora/data/ on your remote ISLE host server in the appropriate storage area. Please attempt to balance as necessary when putting together the docker-compose.yml and config directory. Most instructions will attempt to direct you to copy to a local workstation. ultimately you will be putting this config in a git repository to deploy to the remote ISLE host server for everything to work with both your copied data and merged production settings.

This guide will walk you through how to identify and copy your institution's Islandora data and files (including your data volume, Drupal site or sites, and commonly customized xml and xslt files) to your ISLE framework. Please note: There is a Glossary with relevant terms to help guide installation. Index of related documents Migration Example User Story Migration Export Checklist Migration Merge Checklist Migration Reindex Process Assumptions / Prerequisites Comfortability with ISLE. Recommend first setting up the ISLE Test Site ( isle.localdomain ). If you have already done this, please proceed. Host Server that conforms to the specifications outlined in the Host Server Specifications . This Migration guide is designed for a Host server that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the New ISLE section of the guide. Instructions below also assume a MacOS or Linux laptop or workstation to be used in conjunction with the ISLE Host Server for deploying configs, code, files etc. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed. These directions also depend on the type of local computer used to connect via browser to Islandora. Have an existing domain name that works - is set up with DNS etc... Have SSL Certificates previously created for the web domain. ( Please work with the appropriate internal IT resource to provision these files for your domain ) OR: Use the Let's Encrypt guide to generate and install SSL Certificates. ISLE project has been cloned to BOTH your local laptop/workstation AND the ISLE host server Disk space on or mounted to the Host Server large enough to store a copy of your fedora data store Access to that server from your local workstation via SSH ( islandora user with sudo privileges) Access to the current Islandora production server Usernames/Passwords for key parts of your stack which are used for the migration. Drupal SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original www/sites/default/settings.php Fedora SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original fedora/server/config/fedora.fcfcg Fedora users: please have a copy of your fedora-users.xml Tomcat users: please have a copy of your tomcat-users.xml but plan on generating new values for these logins for both the fedora and solr containers. SQL dump (export) of the current production site's Drupal database. Ensure that the contents of any cache table are not exported. Finally also please note: Instructions from this guide and it's associated checklists may call for you to COPY data from your running Islandora environment to a newly created folder: current_prod_islandora_config located on your ISLE Host Server or local workstation called Local ISLE config laptop . You will then work from this copy for future steps. In some cases, you'll need to copy configurations down to your laptop / workstation ( Local ISLE config laptop ) and merge contents as directed. ( if necessary ) In other cases, due to the size of the data e.g. Fedora data you may only be able to copy production data to the target ISLE Host server ( Remote ISLE Host server ) instead of your local laptop. Please attempt to balance as necessary when putting together the docker-compose.yml and config directory. Most instructions will attempt to direct you to copy to a local workstation. ultimately you will be putting this config in a git repository to deploy to the remote ISLE host server for everything to work with both your copied data and merged production settings. Recommend: Having adequate storage space available for the ISLE host server to accommodate a working copy of a production Islandora's associated configurations and data. Overview TL;DR Copy old stuff over to host server and local laptop w/ checklist, create new private repo for configs, merge old configs into new configs w/ checklist, edit docker-compose.yml to point to new configs, spin up containers, go into fedora container & reindex, qc site - Done. Create a new directory on your remote ISLE Host server for the /data folders and files COPY the drupal/islandora site and configuration files from the running production Islandora (following the Migration Export Checklist ). Create a new directory on your local laptop for the /config folders and files, copy the ISLE repository /config into it, and make this into a private repository. Edit the /config files so they have the proper site-specific information (following the Migration Merge Checklist NOTE Some of this will involve fairly complicated merging of files to account for custom edits that may have been made to your production Islandora site and/or to bring configuration files up to work with newer software versions. This is by far the trickiest part of the migration and definitely a good place to seek help from the community if you get stuck. Edit the docker-compose.yml file to point to all these fine new config files. Download ISLE images from Dockerhub and spin up the ISLE Containers (takes a while depending on network speeds) Go into the fedora container and do a re-indexing (takes a little while) (following the Migration Reindex Process ). Go to the new site and QC! Detailed Steps Setup a Private Code Repository Most of the work in this guide involves careful editing of the various configuration and settings files that customize the pieces of Islandora (database, repository, web-server, etc...). Doing this work in a code repository makes it easier to correct errors and to repeat the process for additional servers without needing to replicate all the work. Since the edits will include things like passwords, it's important to make this a private repository. Customizing for your Environment Many of the steps below describe adding the domain name or other specific bits of information into files or appending those bits to file names. In these cases this guide will call out the customization point AND provide an example - it's important not to literally copy paste the example! Your best guide for these customizations are the source files from your currently running Islandora environment. Create Private Code Repository ON your local laptop/workstation: On the repository of your choice (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) create a PRIVATE remote git repo - see the specific code repository documentation online for setup instructions. Open a terminal - navigate to /opt/ISLE or where you cloned the ISLE directory on your local workstation. Create a directory named yourdomain-config (where \"yourdomain\" is your server domain name) Example: digital-collections.yourdomain.com-config Within the ISLE directory, locate the directory called config/isle-newsite-sample and copy all the contents to the newly created directory cd into the newly copied and renamed yourdomain-config directory and type: git init Initiates this directory as a code repository. Type: git remote add NameOfYourRepository URLofYourRepository Connects your local repository to the remote you set up in the above steps. NOTE: replace \"NameOfYourRepository\" and \"URLofYourRepository\" with the name of your repository and its URL You are now ready to perform the customization edits in this directory (you can use a text editor of choice now don't have to stay in terminal - just locate the folder in the finder and open file in text editor) Create Data Storage Directory This area will be where all current Islandora production data is to be stored. This includes the Apache /var/www/html directory and the appropriate Fedora /usr/local/fedora/data subdirectories outlined below. ON your remote ISLE Host server: Create a directory named yourdomain-data (where \"yourdomain\" is your server domain name) Example: digital-collections.yourdomain.com-data Ensure that the islandora user has ownership and permissions to access this data. chown -Rv islandora:islandora ~/digital-collections.yourdomain.com-data Please note this path may change depending on how your ISLE host server storage area is setup. Migration Export Checklist In the /opt/ISLE/config directory create a new sub-directory (you can call this current_prod_islandora_config ) Copy the files from your current running institutional Islandora Production server(s) into this directory following the Migration Export Checklist of materials on either the local workstation or remote server (in case the data involved is too large for your local workstation) as directed. Noting that most likely the Apache data ( /var/www/html ) & Fedora data ( /usr/local/fedora/data ) will stay on your designated remote ISLE host server storage area not your local laptop used for creating the ISLE config. These copied files will be the source for edits and merges - just to be very clear, please don't work directly on these files in your currently running production Islandora system! To be even more clear, after following the checklist, you should now have two nearly identical /config subdirectories A. copied from the cloned ISLE repository and renamed with your domain e.g. yourdomain-config or digital-collections.yourdomain.com-config B. copied from your currently running Islandora environment. e.g. current_prod_islandora_config Migration Merge Checklist The goal is to merge all site-specific data (domain names, variables, usernames, passwords, etc..) AND all site-specific customizations or settings from the files in directory B. into the matching files in directory A. Compare the data and settings of the files found within directory B. current_prod_islandora_config , and then merge, edit or copy as necessary with the templated settings found within the renamed directory A. yourdomain-config as guided in the Migration Merge Checklist . Customizations: ( optional ) Carefully compare the following most frequently customized files with the new, default versions found within your new ISLE config folder. Use a \"Diff\" tool (example: Beyond Compare to merge any desired customizations from your production Islandora files to persist within the new ISLE config folder of files: Compare and merge the Solr files: schema.xml Compare and merge the Solr files: solrconfig.xml Compare and merge the Solr files: stopwords Compare and merge the Fedora GSearch Islandora Transform (XSLTs) folder of files: islandora_transforms Docker env file: Edit the .env file and change the values of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, BASE_DOMAIN, and CONTAINER_SHORT_ID. e.g. for a production site you may use: COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isleproduction BASE_DOMAIN=mydomain.edu CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=prod Please note: Much of the file is already with comments guiding the enduser to key areas or files to edit or modify accordingly. Final steps Now that all the changes are made (be sure to save), ISLE should be ready to test. First you'll need to push these changes to your private code repository. Open a terminal - cd to the config directory you've been making the changes in... git status this will show you all the files that have been modified and ready to be added to your private repo along with handy paths for the next steps. git add /pathtoyourmodifiedfile (replace \"pathtoyourmodifiedfile\" with the path to your config directory) run these: git add apache git add fedora git add mysql git add proxy git add solr git add docker-compose.yml run git status again - everything should be in green now as all modified files have been added - if anything's still red use git add and the path to add it then run git commit -m \"initial config commit\" inside the double quotes is the commit message you can say whatever you want in this message - so for example if this is the config for your dev instance you could say that... run git push origin master this will push all your changes to the repo further changes should be made on branches for different servers or to master branch for this same server Clone Custom Configuration to Host Server Open a terminal - ssh into your host server using the islandora user cd to /opt/ISLE/config/ because your customizations are in a private repository, you'll need to add this islandora user's id_rsa.pub key to the repository via the website. This key is found in /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub One can simply run cat /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy the output (ensure no whitespaces or extra returns) Go to the repository web site with a browser and locate your private repository. locate the ssh key entry location (in Bitbucket this is in Settings / Access Keys / add an ssh key w/ the label islandora host server paste in the key text and click Add Key Back at your terminal command line, run git clone URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo.git . (replacing \"URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo\" with the URL to the repository provided by the website) cd into the newly cloned directory - this is a good time to check that the ISLE directory contains your yourdomain-config directory and that it reflects all the edits and customizations. Spin up ISLE containers! Review or pull down ISLE Docker images Please Note: You may have already done this in setting up the host server manually and / or with Ansible. However it is always a good idea to review and check using the first command below. Check if all ISLE images have been downloaded docker image ls If yes, then proceed to Step 7 If not, then pull the latest images: docker-compose pull Spin up the proxy container cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d proxy Spin up the mysql container and import production database(s) cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d mysql Two methods for connecting to the MySQL Database (GUI / CLI) pick one. One may use SQL GUI clients e.g. Sequel Pro, Navicat, PHPMyAdmin etc. and import the production Drupal website database(s) If the above not practical, one may connect to the MySQL container and run the following. docker exec -it isle-mysql-institution bash to connect to the container swap out institution for the correct container name. appropriate mysql commands here: consult MySQL documentation - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/ 2a. ( optional ) Only follow this if you have not first run drush cc all and then exported the MySQL databases or if you have not exported the MySQL databases excluding the contents of any table with cache in the name. The following are STEPS, not literal commands to prepare your db for ISLE ( doing this because we've found there are errors using exported db from production because of caches - causes problems - steps below help you remove this problem ) import the production databases into the isle-mysql-institution container ( with errors being ignored ) truncate all tables that start with cache on the isle-mysql-institution container export this new database to the mysql directory on the isle host server delete all tables ( not the database itself ) on the isle-mysql-institution container Reimport the new lighter database to the isle-mysql container Spin up the fedora container and start the reindex processes Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d fedora * optional check if fedora is running properly e.g. http://isle-prod-project.institution:8080/manager/html docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash Follow the steps outlined in the Migration Reindex Process Guide Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex Fedora RI (1 of 3) section Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex SQL database (2 of 3) section Pause here before attempting the steps within the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section. Move onto the next section in this guide, Spin up apache container . Spin up apache container Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d apache docker exec -it isle-apache-institution bash Run the vset script cd /var/www/html ./vsets.sh Edit .htaccess to enforce https echo \"SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-Proto https HTTPS=on\" | tee -a /var/www/html/.htaccess Check if the site is now is running properly by opening a web browser and navigating to your new ISLE domain e.g. https://isle-prod-project.institution Please note while you may be able to see objects being displayed, metadata and search results will be empty until you run the last step in the Reindex process. Troubleshooting Note Sites migrating from a version of Drupal prior to 7.50 may need to update their mysql tables to utf8mb4. On the new site, go to https://isle-prod-project.institution/admin/reports/status (you will need to be logged in as a Drupal Admin) and look for the following error: Instructions for converting the Drupal mysql database are available on the Drupal website Spin up solr container and complete the reindex processes Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d solr ( optional ) check if solr is running properly e.g. http://isle-prod-project.institution:8777/manager/html docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash NOTE FEDORA NOT SOLR! Follow the steps outlined in the Migration Reindex Process Guide Follow the steps outlined only in the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section. ( Ensure that Tomcat and Fedora are running. ) Check the results on the site using Islandora simple search or the appropriate search method.

The suggested workflow is for endusers to review the Production file(s) first, make note of any settings and then make appropriate edits within the yourdomain-config directory to change values, add passwords or usernames etc on your local laptop with the ultimate goal of checking all results into a git repository for deploy later on the ISLE Host server. The only change is that unless otherwise directed e.g. Apache html and Fedora data . all changes should be made on the local laptop in the yourdomain-config directory. Please note as per the migration guide instructions the name of this directory shouldn't literally be \"yourdomain-config\" or \"yourdomain-data\" so replace \"yourdomain\" with the name of your intended Islandora site's domain. While this checklist will attempt to point out most of the merge challenges or pitfalls, you may encounter unique situations depending on the edits and customizations made to your Islandora environment in the past. This is a good place to reach out to the Islandora community for assistance. Please note: In some cases, some of the configuration files copied from your running production Islandora may have comments (#) in them to help guide endusers to make the appropriate edits e.g. (# enduser edit here) In most cases, many of the configuration files copied from ISLE repository to yourdomain-config will have fake or empty settings in them.

Solr index Solr Index - Solr an open source enterprise search platform works in conjunction with the Islandora Solr module to provide a way to configure the Islandora search functions, the search results display, and the display of metadata on object pages. The index serves as a list of those objects for fast searching across large collections. You can use the command-line interactive utility fedora-rebuild.sh on the fedora container to rebuild all indices when the Fedora (not Tomcat) server is offline. Depending on the size of your repository, this entire process may take minutes (thousands of objects) or hours (millions of objects) to complete.

The Ansible script and configuration files can be found in the root folder of the ISLE git repo in a directory named ansible . Additionally, the Ansible script is designed to detect the chosen operating system and then install the appropriate dependencies with minimal user interaction or prior configuration. Ansible is an free open source automation platform / tool which runs on Linux, Mac or BSD, doesn\u2019t use local or remote agents and is relatively easy to setup. Ansible can help with server configuration management, application deployment, task automation and IT orchestration ( running tasks in sequence on several different servers or devices ). If you are not familiar with the Ansible, it is recommended to start with their documentation. Ansible website What is Ansible? Ansible Documentation Notes: For MacOS users using a local ISLE Host VM on their laptop or workstation, please scroll down to line 395 the section called Using Ansible on MacOS . Windows sadly as of yet cannot be used as a Ansible control machine Do not use this script if running Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows as the dependencies are not required. This script can be used with the supplied Vagrant profiles (Ubuntu or CentOS) found within the vagrant directory of the ISLE repo.

At the top of the file remove isle-prod-project.institution and replace with the appropriate fqdn . ansible/inventory.yml This is the possible list of server(s) to deploy to using Ansible and its associated playbook(s). Please Note: These instructions below are repeated within the file itself. Line 7: remove isle-prod-project.institution from in between the brackets and replace with the appropriate fqdn Line 8: Add the appropriate ISLE Host server user account that has sudo passwordless permissions to the end of ansible_ssh_user= Example : ansible_ssh_user=janesmith Line 8: Add the appropriate path to this ISLE Host Server user accounts public ssh key to the end of ansible_ssh_private_key_file= Example of inventory using settings for local Ansible deploy laptop: ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/janesmith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Please Note: This key is typically found on the local control (Ansible deploy laptop / workstation) system and should have been previously copied to the appropriate ISLE Host server user account's /home/islehostserver_user/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

ISLE maintainers are to follow this guide to build the five Docker ISLE images using the docker-compose-build.yml file. Developers can follow this guide if they have edited their Dockerfiles with custom software and they then can push to their own Docker image repository. These images will contain the necessary base code, scripts and files to run the default sample isle.localdomain . This test ISLE / Islandora environment ( isle.localdomain ) includes an un-themed Drupal website and empty Fedora repository for endusers to develop code, test ingests, test metadata, update fields in SOLR indexing and otherwise \"kick the tires\" on ISLE prior for further usages e.g. creating a new ISLE production site or migrating a current Islandora production site to ISLE. While this checklist will attempt to point out most of the usage challenges or pitfalls, ISLE assumes no responsibility or liability in this matter should an enduser have customizations beyond what this guide outlines. Please note: There is a Glossary with relevant terms to help guide installation. Assumptions / Prerequisites Laptop / workstation that conforms to the specifications outlined in the Host Server Specifications This image build site guide is designed for a local laptop / workstation that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the Test/Demo ISLE guide. Instructions below assume a MacOS or Linux laptop or workstation. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed. The ISLE project has been cloned from the ISLE project repository using the master branch. Do not build ISLE images with untested and developmental code. Only stable releases please. Having a cleaned up system prior to any build is key. Ensure that all local development containers, volumes and images associated with the build are deleted. Otherwise previously unaltered data or configurations could break or alter negatively the new images. ISLE maintainers, Developers have pre-existing knowledge or familiarity with Dockerfiles , the Docker Build process and pushing Docker images to repositories. Dockerfiles , their editing process and compositions are familiar or known concepts. ISLE maintainers should already have access to the ISLE Dockerhub image repository. Developers should have already setup their own separate Docker image repository. e.g. Dockerhub following that site's instructions. Developers are free to mix official ISLE images with your own custom image build. Best practice would be to create new Dockerfiles that use the official ISLE images as the base image to build from. Step 1: Ensure there are no local ISLE Docker images present If performing a brand new image build, the ISLE maintainer will need to ensure there are no previous image builds or cached build data. docker image ls Remove any ISLE images by selecting their IMAGE ID Example: docker image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy 1.13 7cbd80c8b043 13 days ago 109MB islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy latest 7cbd80c8b043 13 days ago 109MB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache 2.4 ba6505e7a428 13 days ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache latest ba6505e7a428 13 days ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache <none> 9bc727f301b8 2 weeks ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy <none> 23cb1c73c232 2 weeks ago 109MB docker image rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 docker image rm -f ba6505e7a428 docker image rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 docker image rm -f 9bc727f301b8 docker image rm -f 23cb1c73c232 Step 2: Rename the docker-compose.yml file Rename the docker-compose.yml file to docker-compose.bak Step 3: Rename the docker-compose-build.yml file Rename the docker-compose-build.yml file to docker-compose.yml Step 3a: Alternative for non-ISLE maintainers only e.g. Developers For non-ISLE maintainers only e.g. Developers (only) you'll need to change the following lines in the newly renamed docker-compose.yml file. image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:latest to image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-mysql:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-fedora:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-apache:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-solr:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-proxy:latest Change only the images you need to rebuild or customize. Step 4: Build the images in this suggested order Please perform these steps one at time. If any errors occur during the build process, troubleshoot and edit the associated Dockerfile. docker-compose build mysql docker-compose build fedora docker-compose build apache docker-compose build proxy docker-compose build solr Step 5: Tag the resulting images This renamed docker-compose-build.yml file will tag all builds by default with the latest tag. Review the current tags found on the Docker Containers & Images Specifications Page. Should the software version change, update this document with the new tags. You will need to tag each image further as needed. There are always two tags for every image, e.g. latest and the specific version of the primary software package used on the image or container. It is possible there will be more tags for different image versions in the future. For example if the installed proxy nginx software changes from 1.13 to 1.14 , change or add the new tag of 1.14 To learn more about tagging, read the official Docker tag documentation. To tag images: docker image ls ( to see the new IMAGE IDs ) docker tag IMAGE ID image/TAG IMAGE ID is the 12-character identification string for the image (listed from the Docker images command), and TAG is our newly created versioning tag. So our command to tag a new proxy image would be: docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 Please note: your IMAGE ID will be different than the examples above. Developers, please note you are welcome to use tags that are useful for your institution e.g. docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-proxy:1.13 Step 6: Push the images to the image repository Please note: These steps assume use of Dockerhub. If you use a different Docker image repository, you'll need to change the following steps per their specific instructions. docker login Example output: Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one. Username (username_here): Enter your Dockerhub username Enter your Dockerhub user password. Push the images one at a time. Please note: Depending on your Internet connection's upload speed this process may take several hours. docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:latest Repeat the process with any additional tags. Please note: Depending on your Internet connection's upload speed this process may take several minutes. docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:2.4 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:3.8.1 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:5.6 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:4.10.4 Step 7: Rename the docker-compose-build.yml file Rename the docker-compose.yml file to docker-compose-build.yml Step 8: Rename the docker-compose.yml file Rename the docker-compose.bak file to docker-compose.yml Steps below are mandatory for any ISLE maintainer but optional (though recommended) for any Developer. Step 9: Delete all recently built and pushed ISLE images on local laptop docker image ls Example commands to repeat for each type of image. docker rm -f IMAGE ID islandoracollabgroup/TAG docker rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 Step 10: Test the images pushed. Pull down the newly pushed images. docker-compose pull Follow the instructions within the docker-compose.yml file or within the Test Site Installation Guide to start up containers and install the ISLE Test Site ( isle.localdomain ). Ensure that all components, connections etc are working, otherwise troubleshoot as required, making the appropriate fixes to the associated Dockerfiles, pushing changes to the ISLE project git repository and then REPEATING this entire build and push process.

For example if the installed proxy nginx software changes from 1.13 to 1.14 , change or add the new tag of 1.14 To learn more about tagging, read the official Docker tag documentation. To tag images: docker image ls ( to see the new IMAGE IDs ) docker tag IMAGE ID image/TAG IMAGE ID is the 12-character identification string for the image (listed from the Docker images command), and TAG is our newly created versioning tag. So our command to tag a new proxy image would be: docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 Please note: your IMAGE ID will be different than the examples above. Developers, please note you are welcome to use tags that are useful for your institution e.g. docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-proxy:1.13","title":"Step 5: Tag the resulting images"},{"location":"05_developer_docs/dev_build_guide/#step-6-push-the-images-to-the-image-repository","text":"Please note: These steps assume use of Dockerhub.

This is just one of many approaches for installing a module using Composer. Composer is a PHP package/dependency manager employed in Drupal 8 and many other PHP-based applications. Some Drupal 7, and subsequently Islandora 7.x, modules may also employ Composer to assist with installation and module management. Composer is included, or 'baked in', to ISLE's Apache container image. You can open a shell inside a running ISLE Apache container ( see these instructions for opening a terminal ina container to use it. When you open a shell inside the Apache container you'll initially be logged in as 'root'; however, Composer should not be run as 'root' so once the shell is open you should switch to the islandora user. Do this by entering sudo su islandora , and your prompt should change to something like this: islandora@dd9ee02aa718:/$ . You can confirm that Composer is installed and accessible by entering composer --version , and you should see something like this in response: Composer version 1.6.3 2018-01-31 16:28:17 . Example: Islandora Multi-Importer The Islandora Multi-Importer (https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer) module uses Composer for installation. The remainder of this guide will demonstrate how to install and enable the Islandora Multi-Importer or IMI . The installation instructions for the IMI module tell us to do the following in the container shell: cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules git clone https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer cd islandora_multi_importer/ composer install If all goes as planned your container now has the Islandora_Multi-Importer installed, but not enabled. To enable the module use Drush like so: drush en islandora_multi_importer -y It's also a good idea to flush Drupal's cache after installing and enabling new modules.

This is just one of many approaches for installing a module using Drush, and in some cases, Git. This technique works, in Islandora version 7.x, for most Drupal and Islandora modules. Drush , a \"Command Line Shell for Drupal\", provides convenient means of installing, configuring, and maintaining a Drupal site (like Islandora). Please see http://www.drush.org/ for much more detail regarding Drush. Git is a version control tool that I hope all readers of this document are already familiar with. If you are not, please consider studying up on it at https://git-scm.com/. Drush and Git are included, or 'baked in', to ISLE's Apache container image. You can open a shell inside a running ISLE Apache container ( see these instructions ) to use them. When you open a shell inside the Apache container you'll initially be logged in as 'root'; however, most Drush and Git operations should not be performed as 'root' so once the shell is open you should switch to the islandora user. Do this by entering sudo su islandora , and your prompt should change to something like this: islandora@dd9ee02aa718:/$ . You can confirm that Drush is installed and accessible by entering drush --version , and you should see something like this in response: Drush Version : 7.4.0 . Likewise, you can confirm that Git is installed and working by entering git --version , and you should see something like this in response: git version 1.9.1 . Two Kinds of Drush Module Installations There may be many kinds of modules that can be installed and configured using Drush, but the most popular are: Drupal Contributed Modules - These are modules developed specifically for Drupal and made available from a repository maintained by Drupal.org. Documentation for all such Drupal 7.x modules can be found at https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/modules. Note that all modules are version-specific, so you can find Drupal 8.x module documentation at https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules. Non-Contributed Modules - Modules that are not offered to, or accepted by, Drupal.org may reside in repositories maintained by the module's author and/or maintainer. Most Islandora-specific modules take this form. These two kinds of modules generally employ different techniques for installation and maintenance. One example of each is presented in the sections that follow. Example: Devel - A Drupal Contributed Module Devel is a Drupal contributed module maintained and distributed by Drupal.org. Its stated purpose, taken directly from the module's README file is: \"...contains helper functions and pages for Drupal developers and inquisitive admins...\". The installation instructions for Devel simply tell us to \"install as usual\", that is generally true of most Drupal.org contributed modules, and the process is extremely simple using Drush. From a terminal in the container shell: cd /var/www/html/web/sites/default drush dl devel drush en devel drush cc all In this command sequence, the cd /var/www/html/sites/default command sets our working directory to correspond with the location of our site's settings.php file. This directory, and file, hold key information about our site, and working from this directory makes subsequent commands easier to use. The drush dl devel command instructs our container to download, dl is Drush shorthand for 'download', the module identified as devel . Drush will automatically determine where to put the downloaded module, but it may prompt you for confirmation of location depending on your circumstances. The third command, drush en devel , instructs our container to 'enable', en is Drush shorthand for 'enable', the module identified as devel . This command, as specified, must be run from a particular working directory so that Drush can determine in which Drupal/Islandora site the module should be applied. Like the dl command, drush en may prompt you to confirm certain operations as it attempts to resolve any dependencies that the module may have. The final command, drush cc all , instructs our container to 'clear all caches', cc is Drush shorthand for 'clear cache. This command is not required, but it is highly recommended, since Drupal and Islandora typically cache a great deal of module information, and failing to clear caches may cause temporary, but unexpected results after a new module is installed. That's it. Your new module is installed and ready to be configured and used. You can visit 'https://isle.localdomain/admin/modules' in your browser to manage the module's configuration, permissions, and more. Example: Oral Histories Solution Pack - A Non-Contrib Islandora Module According to its README.md file, the Oral Histories Solution Pack \"Provides a content model for Oral Histories and a viewer for displaying timed text content (XML or WebVTT) alongside video and audio files.\" The remainder of this guide will demonstrate how to install and enable the Oral Histories Solution Pack inside your running Apache container using Git and Drush. The full installation instructions for the Oral Histories Solution Pack are relatively complex since there are a number of dependencies, and some necessary Solr configuration in order to be fully functional. Please see the README for complete details. To begin the process of downloading, installing and configuring the Oral History Solution Pack do the following at the terminal inside your container: cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git cd /var/www/html/sites/default drush en islandora_oralhistories -y drush cc all In this command sequence, the cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib command sets our working directory to correspond with the location where we want our module to reside. The git clone... command downloads the Oral History solution pack code from its repository on Github. If all goes smoothly this step will create a new islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories directory. The cd /var/www/html/sites/default command sets our working directory to the location of our site's settings.php file. This directory, and file, hold key information about our site, and working from this directory makes subsequent commands easier to use. The command, drush en islandora_oralhistories -y , instructs our container to 'enable', en is Drush shorthand for 'enable', the module identified as islandora_oralhistories .

Note that drush en may prompt you to confirm certain operations as it attempts to resolve any dependencies that the module may have.

Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. ISLE is an orchestrated group of Docker containers to be run on a server, laptop or cloud instance with a minimal suite of tools enabling an efficient deploy and release of an updated production-ready Islandora environment. ISLE functions as both an initial installer and maintenance updater with the ability to build new production, staging and sandbox environments as distributable, lightweight and fast \u201ccontainers\u201d in a Docker Engine environment. This process allows folks to choose between hosting: locally on a laptop for development work on site in an institutional data center in a cloud environment such as ( Amazon Web Services ). ISLE\u2019s production-ready platform will be updated monthly with: critical security patches full stack software updates a suite of commonly installed features and solution packs. ISLE is designed to be an evolving but trusted environment to help create a managed process for migrating to the next major release of Islandora (termed CLAW). Project Overview ISLE public repository: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE How does it work? ISLE separates an institution\u2019s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora. ISLE also bundles together the best shared modules into a common, production-ready and security-hardened platform. Why is it needed? Islandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of more than 80 different open-source software libraries. This complex ecosystem makes Islandora difficult and expensive to install, maintain and customize. ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new schools while allowing existing institutions to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance. High Level Objective To deliver a secure and production-ready Islandora stack (\u201cISLE\u201d) that reduces the involved support time and effort for installation, maintenance and customization. ISLE Functional Definition By ISLE, it is meant a system that will: Function as both an initial installer and maintenance updater for Islandora stacks with up-to-date components suitable for use as staging, development or production environments, as well as for use on personal computers for development work. Consist of a public, tagged set of Docker containers. Include use of an orchestration tool such as Docker Composer. Allow for the replacement of older containers with newer versions. Be updated to include new component security patch releases within one calendar month. Support institution-specific customizations (XSLTs/Islandora Transforms, Solr, schemas, config.xml, MODS configurations/forms, XACML policies) able to persist through container upgrades and replacements. These will be stored in a git repository and a mechanism will be provided to reintegrate with the installed Docker containers as part of an upgrade. Support for either institutional hosting or Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the Docker host server. Support data store flexibility on institutional hosting or an AWS cloud environment. Encompass critical security patches, and full stack software updates, plus dependencies for commonly installed features and all available solution packs. Include an integrated ISLE/Islandora test suite (expected to utilize TravisCI) to be utilized, developed in conjunction with the Islandora Foundation and the current Islandora release managers Include documentation that covers end usage, a how-to guide to set up an initial ISLE installation, a how-to guide for an established installation to upgrade containers to the latest versions, and a functional description of mechanics, administrative system management and the process for future ISLE development ISLE Documents ISLE Executive Summary (a concise overview in plain English) ISLE Specifications (based on the older, now closed, ISLE MVP doc) ISLE Supporters (list of institutions)","title":"About ISLE"},{"location":"08_about/about/#project-overview","text":"ISLE public repository: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"08_about/about/#how-does-it-work","text":"ISLE separates an institution\u2019s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora.

There are major benefits both for the maintainers and users of ISLE. Keeping our users safe has never been easier. For users and maintainers alike when a security update or patch arrives we (the ISLE maintainers) need only update the base image. By virtue of inheritance these updates are automatically inherited and built into each and every component of the ISLE stack. Quick downloads, faster launch: these shared base images decrease the time to pull and launch the ISLE stack. Since the images have the same layers (like a cake) they are downloaded only once and reused as building blocks for the rest of the ISLE stack. This also significantly decreases the overall size of all images because we are able to finely tune and trim our base images so they\u2019re stable, without being bloated by unneeded components. ISLE-Ubuntu-Base ISLE-Tomcat-Base Image-Services Image Services with an S . ImageServices is a 1.2 GB container that simultaneously runs both Adore-Djatoka and Cantaloupe IIIF .
