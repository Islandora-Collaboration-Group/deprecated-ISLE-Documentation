Islandora is an open-source software framework designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. ISLE is an orchestrated group of Docker containers to be run on a server, laptop or cloud instance with a minimal suite of tools enabling an efficient deploy and release of an updated production-ready Islandora environment. ISLE functions as both an initial installer and maintenance updater with the ability to build new production, staging, or development environments as distributable, lightweight and fast \u201ccontainers\u201d in a Docker Engine environment. This process allows folks to choose between hosting: locally on a laptop for development work on site in an institutional data center in a cloud environment such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform . ISLE\u2019s production-ready platform will be updated monthly with: critical security patches full stack software updates a suite of commonly installed features and solution packs. ISLE is designed to be an evolving but trusted environment to help create a managed process for migrating to the next major release of Islandora (termed CLAW). Project Overview ISLE public repository: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE How Does It Work? ISLE separates an institution\u2019s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates of Islandora. ISLE also bundles together the best shared modules into a common, production-ready and security-hardened platform. Why Is It Needed? Islandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of more than 80 different open-source software libraries. This complex ecosystem makes Islandora difficult and expensive to install, maintain and customize. ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new schools while allowing existing institutions to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance. High Level Objective To deliver a secure and production-ready Islandora stack (\u201cISLE\u201d) that reduces the involved support time and effort for installation, maintenance and customization. ISLE Functional Definition By ISLE, it is meant a system that will: Function as both an initial installer and maintenance updater for Islandora stacks with up-to-date components suitable for use as staging, development or production environments, as well as for use on personal computers for development work. Consist of a public, tagged set of Docker containers. Include use of an orchestration tool such as Docker Composer. Allow for the replacement of older containers with newer versions. Be updated to include new component security patch releases within one calendar month. Support institution-specific customizations (XSLTs/Islandora Transforms, Solr, schemas, config.xml, MODS configurations/forms, XACML policies) able to persist through container upgrades and replacements. These will be stored in a git repository and a mechanism will be provided to reintegrate with the installed Docker containers as part of an upgrade. Support for either institutional hosting or Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the Docker host server. Support data store flexibility on institutional hosting or an AWS cloud environment. Encompass critical security patches, and full stack software updates, plus dependencies for commonly installed features and all available solution packs. Include an integrated ISLE/Islandora test suite (expected to utilize TravisCI) to be utilized, developed in conjunction with the Islandora Foundation and the current Islandora release managers Include documentation that covers end usage, a how-to guide to set up an initial ISLE installation, a how-to guide for an established installation to upgrade containers to the latest versions, and a functional description of mechanics, administrative system management and the process for future ISLE development ISLE Documents ISLE Executive Summary (a concise overview and history of the ISLE project) ISLE Specifications (based on the older, now closed, ISLE MVP doc) ISLE Supporters (list of institutions)","title":"About ISLE"},{"location":"about/about-isle/#project-overview","text":"ISLE public repository: https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"about/about-isle/#how-does-it-work","text":"ISLE separates an institution\u2019s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates of Islandora.

This document assumes the use of the docker-compose command and docker-compose.yml, though there are other ways to specify how docker uses volumes and bind mounts. For more complete descriptions of bind mounts and volumes, and their management, please see the official docker documentation. Data , in this context, can include digital objects, files, logs, code, or information stored in mysql, solr, or fedora. Essentially, anything typically written to or read from disk in some format, is data. Each time a docker container is brought up using a command like docker-compose up -d the container is recreated using the base container image. When a process in the container creates or changes a file (for example, an apache log file) those changes only exist while the container is running. If the container is brought down and back up again, it is recreated using the base image, which will not include the apache log. In order to preserve certain data--for example, the Fedora datastore, Drupal\u2019s database and files, etc, ISLE uses volumes and/or bind mounts defined in 'docker-compose.yml'. Data written to volumes and bind mounts are different to other data in Docker in two important ways: It is persistent, so it will survive when there is an update to the base ISLE docker images It can be read and written from the host easily and safely Bind mounts vs volumes: Docker provides two different ways to persist data: Volumes and bind mounts , described below. For simplicity, in this document, persisted refers to any data or directory stored in either a bind mount or volume. Volumes Volumes can be named in the docker-compose.yml file and are managed by docker. In the host system, the directories will be created in the Docker store (on Linux, usually /var/lib/docker). If the volume does not already exist, it will be created on docker-compose up. Below is an example docker-compose.yml directive for an apache container using a volume: volumes: apache-data:/var/www/html Explanation: If not already created, docker will create a directory on the host at '/var/lib/docker' and use that for the apache container\u2019s '/var/www/html' directory. Bind Mounts Bind mounts map a directory in the container to a directory anywhere on the host and are not managed directly by docker. Below is an example 'docker-compose.yml' directive for an apache container using a bind mount: volumes: /opt/ISLE/apache/html:/var/www/html Explanation: Data in the host\u2019s /opt/ISLE/apache/html directory will be in the apache container\u2019s /var/www/html. If the directory does not exist on the host, it will NOT be created on docker-compose up -d , so be sure to create any necessary directories on the host manually. If the container\u2019s '/var/www/html/' directory has content, it will be masked by the contents of the host\u2019s '/opt/ISLE/apache/html/' directory. What should be persisted this way? Data and directories that store data unique to your Islandora, such as the Fedora datastore, Solr index, and the full Drupal directory, should be persisted, as should the mysql data directories and some configuration files (those not generated via the .env files). This will ensure that your customizations and content remain even after ISLE containers are updated. It may be useful to write logs to a persisted directory to make accessing and managing the logs easier, and to provide sufficient capacity for log storage. If your workflows involve moving digital objects onto the Islandora server for local ingest, it may be useful to have a persisted directory designated for those objects. The alternative is to put them on the host server, then use scp or docker cp to copy them into the container, which adds steps to the process. What should NOT be persisted? Application data that is not meant to be customized or unique to your institution should not be persisted, but instead managed within the docker container (as it is by default). Example: The ISLE team updates the apache container to apache2\u2019s latest security release. If the directory containing apache\u2019s binary is in a persisted directory, then updating ISLE will NOT automatically provide the latest apache, and you will continue to run the older, insecure apache until you manually update it inside the container. This negates many of the benefits of using ISLE. Which should I use, bind mounts or volumes? The answer for this is \u201cit depends\u201d. Bind mounts may be easier to get to on a host machine as you have more control over where they are. If you are migrating an existing installation, you will almost certainly want to copy over things like your /var/www/html directory and Fedora store and use a bind mount to point to them. The solr index, however, should not be migrated over but rather rebuilt. It doesn\u2019t need to exist before the containers do. It is also unlikely that a user would want to navigate to the solr directory via command line on the host and edit files directly. A named volume would probably work fine in this case, and be more easily managed by docker.","title":"Data Persistence in Docker"},{"location":"appendices/data-persistence/#data-persistence-in-docker","text":"Please note this is a simplified explanation of how Docker stores data in relation to a typical ISLE installation.

Docker Containers : Docker containers are lightweight, stand-alone, executable packages of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Each major component of Islandora runs in its own container. Docker : used to build ISLE - Docker is used to create containers (similar to virtual servers) based on pre-built images. A \"recipe\" file called docker-compose.yml orchestrates the setting up and networking of the containers. Dockerfile : Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile . A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession. Docker for Mac : Docker for Mac is an easy-to-install desktop app for building, debugging and testing Dockerized apps on a Mac. Docker for Mac is a complete development environment deeply integrated with the MacOS Hypervisor framework, networking and filesystem Dockerhub : website / repository that provides access to the latest Docker images for the ISLE containers. Host Server : Also called \"the host\" - this is the base computer upon which the entire ISLE stack is built - this can be a virtual machine on a laptop (LOCAL), or a server you connected to via ssh (REMOTE). Images : Docker images - source for the containers - these are built with installed software and updated by ISLE developers and stored on Dockerhub. You can see what software is used in each of the image's Dockerfiles e.g. apache/Dockerfile etc. This will contain additional information on official Docker images used as a Docker base image ISLE on GitHub : the ISLE repository on github.com contains documentation and configuration files necessary to build ISLE. Network refers to a defined Docker network that is controlled by docker. This has powerful implications in production. ISLE services: fedora , solr , apache , mysql , and proxy communicate using an internal private stack network. The service proxy also joins an insecure network that is accessible to the WAN (or for testing \"WAN\" likely means a smaller internal network). Why two networks? Swarms, scaling, replicating. Volume a Docker controlled place to hold data on the local file system. Used to persist data across containers. Documentation / Development CLI / cli - A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface[1] and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell. Git - A free and open source distributed software version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. https://git-scm.com/ The ISLE project and its documentation is hosted by an online git service called Github.com Git branches - Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (e.g. debugging output) or transmitted (e.g. document headers). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML http://yaml.org/ Solr Please note: Online versions of the SOLR documentation are for 6.6+ or higher, ISLE currently users version 4.10.4 only. Solr - an open source enterprise search platform with the such features as full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features[1] and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance. Learn more about Solr here Learn more about using Solr 4.10.4 Core - In Solr, the term core is used to refer to a single index and associated transaction log and configuration files (including the solrconfig.xml and Schema files, among others). Your Solr installation can have multiple cores if needed, which allows you to index data with different structures in the same server, and maintain more control over how your data is presented to different audiences. schema.xml - Solr organizes its data into documents, which consist of fields. The schema.xml file contains information about these fields, how they are analyzed and then filtered during searches. Different field types can contain different types of data so Solr uses the schema.xml file to determine how to build indexes from these input documents, and how to perform index and query time processing. solr.xml - The solr.xml file specifies configuration options for each Solr core, including configuration options for multiple cores. The file also contains mappings for request URLs, and indicates which cores to load when the server starts. solrconfig.xml - The solrconfig.xml file is the configuration file with the most parameters affecting Solr itself. In solrconfig.xml, you configure important features such as: request handlers, which process the requests to Solr, such as requests to add documents to the index or requests to return results for a query listeners processes that \"listen\" for particular query-related events. Listeners can be used to trigger the execution of special code, such as invoking some common queries to warm-up caches and much more... stopwords.txt - The stopwords.txt file is a configuration file that lists the words to be used by the Solr stop filter to be excluded from appearing or being used for searches. Examples of these common words are a large list that can include \"a\", \"the\", or \"is\" which in a page could easily appear hundreds of times or more. When a user performs a search, an algorithm calculates the relevancy of any document in the search index by counting the number of times a word appears in the text being searched and since words like \"the\" have no bearing on a document's actual relevancy; they are then excluded from this ranking algorithm's results. Systems cronjob - The software utility cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration Learn more here . This is used by such utilities like tmpreaper and the Drupal site on the apache container. domain - A domain name is your website name for the IP address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of numbers. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. Learn more about domains here or here dhparam - A script to create this file can be found in the /config/isle-sample/proxy/config/ssl-certs directory. This file is used in conjunction with the nginx reverse proxy on the proxy container to further secure the communication / traffic between the external network (ISLE Host) and the internal ISLE network (other four containers.) The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is an alternative to RSA-based key exchange using an ephemeral but slower Diffie-Hellman algorithm which generates session keys in such a way that only the two parties involved in the communication can obtain them. No one else can, even if they have access to the server's private key. After the session is complete, and both parties destroy the session keys, the only way to decrypt the communication is to break the session keys themselves. This protocol feature is known as Forward Secrecy. Learn more about Diffie-Hellman parameters environment - An ISLE environment can be a production, development or staging environment. However ISLE is flexible and can be named anything using any convention of the end user's desire, one is not forced to do the following. Following a recommended workflow of \"code up, data down\" for Islandora development typically: a production ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all production (final and tested) potentially public facing code, themes, databases and a full amount of collection data or objects. a staging ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all running all pre-production (final and tested) private (non-public) facing code, themes, databases and a full amount of collection data or objects. staging should be an exact mirror of production (RAM, CPU, storage etc) with the exception of new code to be reviewed and tested internally prior to pushing to production. a development ISLE environment is a separate ISLE instance running all development (experimental and untested) private (non-public) facing code, themes, databases and a limited amount of collection data or objects. development should not be a mirror of production and can be greatly limited and underpowered in its resource footprint e.g. less RAM, CPU, HD etc. Root User - the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root, root user and the superuser.

The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users. Learn more about SSH SSL certificates - files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization\u2019s web domain (URL). To enable HTTPS on your website, you need to get a certificate (a type of file) from a Certificate Authority (CA). When installed on a web server, the browser will display a padlock icon and https will appear as the prefix to the URL to indicate a secure connection between the web server and user's browser. SSL certificates are used to secure credit card transactions, data transfer, logins, and more. Generate SSL certificates by using ONE of the following methods: Ask your IT department to provision a complete SSL Certificate Chain . On your Remote Server ISLE Installation you will place the SSL certificates into the ./ISLE/config/proxy/ssl-certs directory. These SSL certificates are used by the apache & proxy Docker containers. Use Let's Encrypt , a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority for generating SSL certificates for your ISLE environment. In order to get a certificate for your website\u2019s domain from Let\u2019s Encrypt, you have to demonstrate control over the domain. With Let\u2019s Encrypt, you do this using software that uses the ACME protocol, which typically runs on your web host. To begin, visit the Let's Encrypt: Free SSL Certificates ISLE guide. Additional resources: Why SSL? The Purpose of using SSL Certificates How to Configure Nginx SSL Certifcate Chain The SSLCertificateChainFile Directive directive sets the optional all-in-one file where you can assemble the certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) which form the certificate chain of the server certificate. (e.g. /certs/sample-interm.pem used as an example in later documentation. This file may be optional in some setups but is generally recommended for use by the apache container when available.) The SSLCertificateFile Directive directive points to a file with certificate data in PEM format. At a minimum, the file must include an end-entity (leaf) certificate. (e.g. /certs/sample.pem used as an example in later documentation. This file is required in all setups.) The SSLCertificateKeyFile Directive directive points to the PEM-encoded private key file for the server. If the contained private key is encrypted, the pass phrase dialog is forced at startup time. (e.g. /certs/sample-key.pem used as an example in later documentation.

Virtualization Vagrant : Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments. Vagrant works on Mac, Linux, Windows, and more. Within the ISLE project there is a vagrant folder. Vagrantfile : Vagrantfile used to describe the type of virtual machine required for the ISLE project, and how to configure and provision these virtual machines. Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is Vagrantfile. Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project which allows endusers to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are used primarily for use on local workstations and laptops running a Ubuntu or CentOS ISLE Host server.

This is just one of many approaches for installing a module using Composer. Composer is a PHP package/dependency manager employed in Drupal 8 and many other PHP-based applications. Some Drupal 7, and subsequently Islandora 7.x, modules may also employ Composer to assist with installation and module management. Composer is included, or 'baked in', to ISLE's Apache container image. You can open a shell inside a running ISLE Apache container ( see these instructions for opening a terminal in a container to use it. When you open a shell inside the Apache container you'll initially be logged in as 'root'; however, Composer should not be run as 'root' so once the shell is open you should switch to the islandora user. Do this by entering sudo su islandora , and your prompt should change to something like this: islandora@dd9ee02aa718:/$ . You can confirm that Composer is installed and accessible by entering composer --version , and you should see something like this in response: Composer version 1.6.3 2018-01-31 16:28:17 . Example: Islandora Multi-Importer (IMI) The Islandora Multi-Importer (https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer) module uses Composer for installation. The remainder of this guide will demonstrate how to install and enable the Islandora Multi-Importer or IMI . The installation instructions for the IMI module tell us to do the following in the container shell: cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules git clone https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer cd islandora_multi_importer/ composer install If all goes as planned your container now has the Islandora_Multi-Importer installed, but not enabled. To enable the module use Drush like so: drush en islandora_multi_importer -y It's also a good idea to flush Drupal's cache after installing and enabling new modules. You can also do this using Drush like so: drush cc all Other modules which use Composer for installation can be obtained in a similar manner. Persistent Changes Modules installed in this manner essentially become part of the container they're installed in. If the container is deleted the installation may not persist. However, in most ISLE configurations, like isle.localdomain, the Apache portion of the governing docker-compose.yml file reads something like this: apache: image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:latest container_name: isle-apache-ld networks: isle-internal: aliases: - isle.localdomain tty: true depends_on: - mysql - fedora - solr volumes: - apache-data-ld:/var/www/html - ./data/apache/log/apache:/var/log/apache2 The first volumes definition in this portion of the file instructs Docker to map the host's apache-data-ld directory to be reflected inside the container as /var/www/html .

Drush , a \"Command Line Shell for Drupal\", provides convenient means of installing, configuring, and maintaining a Drupal site (like Islandora). Please see http://www.drush.org/ for much more detail regarding Drush. Git is a version control tool that I hope all readers of this document are already familiar with. If you are not, please consider studying up on it at https://git-scm.com/. Drush and Git are included, or 'baked in', to ISLE's Apache container image. You can open a shell inside a running ISLE Apache container ( see these instructions ) to use them. When you open a shell inside the Apache container you'll initially be logged in as 'root'; however, most Drush and Git operations should not be performed as 'root' so once the shell is open you should switch to the islandora user.

Likewise, you can confirm that Git is installed and working by entering git --version , and you should see something like this in response: git version 1.9.1 . Two Kinds of Drush Module Installations There may be many kinds of modules that can be installed and configured using Drush, but the most popular are: Drupal Contributed Modules - These are modules developed specifically for Drupal and made available from a repository maintained by Drupal.org. Documentation for all such Drupal 7.x modules can be found at https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/modules. Note that all modules are version-specific, so you can find Drupal 8.x module documentation at https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules. Non-Contributed Modules - Modules that are not offered to, or accepted by, Drupal.org may reside in repositories maintained by the module's author and/or maintainer. Most Islandora-specific modules take this form. These two kinds of modules generally employ different techniques for installation and maintenance. One example of each is presented in the sections that follow. Example: Devel - A Drupal Contributed Module Devel is a Drupal contributed module maintained and distributed by Drupal.org. Its stated purpose, taken directly from the module's README file is: \"...contains helper functions and pages for Drupal developers and inquisitive admins...\". The installation instructions for Devel simply tell us to \"install as usual\", that is generally true of most Drupal.org contributed modules, and the process is extremely simple using Drush. From a terminal in the container shell: cd /var/www/html/web/sites/default drush dl devel drush en devel drush cc all In this command sequence, the cd /var/www/html/sites/default command sets our working directory to correspond with the location of our site's settings.php file. This directory, and file, hold key information about our site, and working from this directory makes subsequent commands easier to use. The drush dl devel command instructs our container to download, dl is Drush shorthand for 'download', the module identified as devel . Drush will automatically determine where to put the downloaded module, but it may prompt you for confirmation of location depending on your circumstances. The third command, drush en devel , instructs our container to 'enable', en is Drush shorthand for 'enable', the module identified as devel . This command, as specified, must be run from a particular working directory so that Drush can determine in which Drupal/Islandora site the module should be applied. Like the dl command, drush en may prompt you to confirm certain operations as it attempts to resolve any dependencies that the module may have. The final command, drush cc all , instructs our container to 'clear all caches', cc is Drush shorthand for 'clear cache. This command is not required, but it is highly recommended, since Drupal and Islandora typically cache a great deal of module information, and failing to clear caches may cause temporary, but unexpected results after a new module is installed. That's it. Your new module is installed and ready to be configured and used. You can visit 'https://isle.localdomain/admin/modules' in your browser to manage the module's configuration, permissions, and more. Example: Oral Histories Solution Pack - A Non-Contrib Islandora Module According to its README.md file, the Oral Histories Solution Pack \"Provides a content model for Oral Histories and a viewer for displaying timed text content (XML or WebVTT) alongside video and audio files.\" The remainder of this guide will demonstrate how to install and enable the Oral Histories Solution Pack inside your running Apache container using Git and Drush. The full installation instructions for the Oral Histories Solution Pack are relatively complex since there are a number of dependencies, and some necessary Solr configuration in order to be fully functional. Please see the README for complete details. To begin the process of downloading, installing and configuring the Oral History Solution Pack do the following at the terminal inside your container: cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git cd /var/www/html/sites/default drush en islandora_oralhistories -y drush cc all In this command sequence, the cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib command sets our working directory to correspond with the location where we want our module to reside. The git clone... command downloads the Oral History solution pack code from its repository on GitHub. If all goes smoothly this step will create a new islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories directory. The cd /var/www/html/sites/default command sets our working directory to the location of our site's settings.php file. This directory, and file, hold key information about our site, and working from this directory makes subsequent commands easier to use. The command, drush en islandora_oralhistories -y , instructs our container to 'enable', en is Drush shorthand for 'enable', the module identified as islandora_oralhistories .

Note that drush en may prompt you to confirm certain operations as it attempts to resolve any dependencies that the module may have. The final command, drush cc all , instructs our container to 'clear all caches', cc is Drush shorthand for 'clear cache.

The site was installed and set up by a colleague who has since left. Some components are outdated and the work of maintaining the server and software stack is taking up a lot of Laverne's time. She's decided to try migrating the site to a new one built with ISLE. She begins by requesting a second server from IT - based on the [System_Requirements]. IT prefers not to give clients root-level access so they agree to make Laverne a user called islandora according to the [Host_Server_Setup] instructions and provide her with the SSH login instructions. The new server has attached storage large enough to hold a copy of the existing Fedora data store from the old server. Additionally, Laverne requests a new URL for the ISLE-based Islandora site \"https://digital.university-college.edu\" and ensures that IT has created DNS records so that this URL directs to the new server. Once she has access to the server and has installed the necessary software including the ISLE repository files from GitHub [Host_Server_Setup], Larverne is ready for the step-by-step [Migration_Guide]. She begins by creating a place-holder directory in the new server for all the existing Islandora site data - and copying that data over from the old server using the [migration_export_checklist] as a guide. This data will be left in the place-holder directory as a backup during the coming migration process. Laverne now creates the permanent directory structure for ISLE to use in customizing the Islandora install and re-copies the data into this structure from the place-holder directory. Since this is merely a test, she's going to skip the process of setting up an institutional Git Repository for her customization files and move on to the merge section of the guide. Working through the [migration_merge_checklist], Laverne ensures that the directories and files listed have been copied into the ISLE directory structure created above. As specified in the checklist, some of these files are slightly different in her current production Islandora. For example, the and that they have been compared to (and in some cases merged by hand) with the stock up-to-date versions of these files that come with ISLE. This turns out to be the most complex part of the entire migration process and Laverne reaches out to the [ISLE_Group_List] for assistance with a couple of the configuration files that had been edited in the past by the colleague who set up the original Islandora system. Finally, she makes the necessary edits to the docker-compose.yml file to add the necessary connection specific information. This is where she will insert the new URL and IP addresses along with a number of other site-specific customizations [migration_docker_compose_checklist]. Now she can enter the commands from the [Migration_Guide] to download the container images from Dockerhub and start them according to the instructions. After the Fedora container is up and running, Laverne follows the steps to test that all is well and sees a running Tomcat server w/ a list of running applications including fedora and Fedoragsearch.

This turns out to be the most complex part of the entire migration process and Laverne reaches out to the [ISLE_Group_List] for assistance with a couple of the configuration files that had been edited in the past by the colleague who set up the original Islandora system. Finally, she makes the necessary edits to the docker-compose.yml file to add the necessary connection specific information. This is where she will insert the new URL and IP addresses along with a number of other site-specific customizations [migration_docker_compose_checklist]. Now she can enter the commands from the [Migration_Guide] to download the container images from Dockerhub and start them according to the instructions. After the Fedora container is up and running, Laverne follows the steps to test that all is well and sees a running Tomcat server w/ a list of running applications including fedora and Fedoragsearch. After starting the remaining containers, Laverne runs the Apache install script. If all goes well the next step will be to point a browser at the new URL and see a working Islandora site!","title":"User Story: Migrating an Islandora Site to ISLE"},{"location":"appendices/user-story-new-site/","text":"User Story: Building a New Islandora Site Using ISLE Sam wants to spin up Islandora on an Ubuntu Linux server she has in the institutional data center.

The Ansible script and configuration files can be found in the root folder of the ISLE git repository in a directory named ansible . Additionally, the Ansible script is designed to detect the chosen operating system and then install the appropriate dependencies with minimal user interaction or prior configuration. Ansible is an free open source automation platform / tool which runs on Linux, Mac or BSD, doesn\u2019t use local or remote agents and is relatively easy to setup. Ansible can help with server configuration management, application deployment, task automation and IT orchestration ( running tasks in sequence on several different servers or devices ). If you are not familiar with the Ansible, it is recommended to start with their documentation. Ansible website What is Ansible? Ansible Documentation Notes: For MacOS users using a local ISLE Host VM on their workstation, please scroll down to line 395 the section called Using Ansible on MacOS . Windows sadly as of yet cannot be used as a Ansible control machine Do not use this script if running Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows as the dependencies are not required. This script can be used with the supplied Vagrant profiles (Ubuntu or CentOS) found within the vagrant directory of the ISLE repository.

Highly dependent on the Developer's local laptop and Internet speed. Caution : This guide is recommended for ISLE Committers or Developers only and not for end-users. ISLE Committers are to follow this guide to build the five Docker ISLE images using the docker-compose-build.yml file. Developers can follow this guide if they have edited their Dockerfiles with custom software and they then can push to their own Docker image repository. These images will contain the necessary base code, scripts and files to run the default sample https://isle.localdomain . The Demo ISLE Installation creates a local Islandora platform ( https://isle.localdomain ) on your workstation. This process includes an un-themed Drupal website and an empty Fedora repository so you may ingest test objects, add or edit metadata, update fields in SOLR indexing, develop code, and otherwise \"kick the tires\" on ISLE. Please post questions to the public Islandora ISLE Google group , or subscribe to receive emails. The Glossary defines terms used in this documentation. Assumptions / Prerequisites Laptop / workstation that conforms to the specifications outlined in the Hardware Requirements This image build site guide is designed for a local laptop / workstation that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the Demo ISLE Installation guide. Instructions below assume a MacOS or Linux workstation. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed. The ISLE project has been cloned from the ISLE project repository using the master branch. Do not build ISLE images with untested and developmental code. Only stable releases please. Having a cleaned up system prior to any build is key. Ensure that all local development containers, volumes and images associated with the build are deleted. Otherwise previously unaltered data or configurations could break or alter negatively the new images. ISLE Committers, Developers have pre-existing knowledge or familiarity with Dockerfiles , the Docker Build process and pushing Docker images to repositories. Dockerfiles , their editing process and compositions are familiar or known concepts. ISLE Committers should already have access to the ISLE Dockerhub image repository. Developers should have already setup their own separate Docker image repository. e.g. Dockerhub following that site's instructions. Developers are free to mix official ISLE images with your own custom image build. Best practice would be to create new Dockerfiles that use the official ISLE images as the base image to build from. Step 1: Ensure There Are No Local ISLE Docker Images Present If performing a brand new image build, the ISLE Committer will need to ensure there are no previous image builds or cached build data. docker image ls Remove any ISLE images by selecting their IMAGE ID Example: docker image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy 1.13 7cbd80c8b043 13 days ago 109MB islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy latest 7cbd80c8b043 13 days ago 109MB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache 2.4 ba6505e7a428 13 days ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache latest ba6505e7a428 13 days ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache <none> 9bc727f301b8 2 weeks ago 2.25GB islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy <none> 23cb1c73c232 2 weeks ago 109MB docker image rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 docker image rm -f ba6505e7a428 docker image rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 docker image rm -f 9bc727f301b8 docker image rm -f 23cb1c73c232 Step 2: Rename the docker-compose.yml File Rename the docker-compose.yml file to docker-compose.bak Step 3: Rename the docker-compose-build.yml File Rename the docker-compose-build.yml file to docker-compose.yml Step 3a: Alternative for Non-ISLE Committers only (e.g. developers) If you're working in your own dockerhub environment (ie, not the offical islandoracollabgroup environment, then you'll need to change the following lines in the newly renamed docker-compose.yml file. image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:latest image: islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:latest to image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-mysql:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-fedora:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-apache:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-solr:latest image: yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-proxy:latest Change only the images you need to rebuild or customize. Step 4: Build the Images in this Suggested Order Please perform these steps one at time. If any errors occur during the build process, troubleshoot and edit the associated Dockerfile. docker-compose build mysql docker-compose build fedora docker-compose build apache docker-compose build proxy docker-compose build solr Step 5: Tag the Resulting Images This renamed docker-compose-build.yml file will tag all builds by default with the latest tag. Review the current tags found on the Docker Containers & Images Specifications Page. Should the software version change, update this document with the new tags. You will need to tag each image further as needed. There are always two tags for every image, e.g. latest and the specific version of the primary software package used on the image or container. It is possible there will be more tags for different image versions in the future. For example if the installed proxy nginx software changes from 1.13 to 1.14 , change or add the new tag of 1.14 To learn more about tagging, read the official Docker tag documentation. To tag images: docker image ls ( to see the new IMAGE IDs ) docker tag IMAGE ID image/TAG IMAGE ID is the 12-character identification string for the image (listed from the Docker images command), and TAG is our newly created versioning tag. So our command to tag a new proxy image would be: docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 Please note: your IMAGE ID will be different than the examples above. Developers, please note you are welcome to use tags that are useful for your institution e.g. docker tag 7cbd80c8b043 yourdockerimagerepo_orgname/isle-proxy:1.13 Step 6: Push the Images to the Image Repository Please note: These steps assume use of Dockerhub. If you use a different Docker image repository, you'll need to change the following steps per their specific instructions. docker login Example output: Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one. Username (username_here): Enter your Dockerhub username Enter your Dockerhub user password. Push the images one at a time. Please note: Depending on your Internet connection's upload speed this process may take several hours. docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:latest docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:latest Repeat the process with any additional tags. Please note: Depending on your Internet connection's upload speed this process may take several minutes. docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-apache:2.4 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-fedora:3.8.1 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-mysql:5.6 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 docker push islandoracollabgroup/isle-solr:4.10.4 Step 7: Rename the docker-compose-build.yml File Rename the docker-compose.yml file to docker-compose-build.yml Step 8: Rename the docker-compose.yml File Rename the docker-compose.bak file to docker-compose.yml Steps below are mandatory for any ISLE Committer but optional (though recommended) for any Developer. Step 9: Delete All Recently Built and Pushed ISLE Images on Local Laptop docker image ls Example commands to repeat for each type of image. docker rm -f IMAGE ID islandoracollabgroup/TAG docker rm -f 7cbd80c8b043 islandoracollabgroup/isle-proxy:1.13 Step 10: Test the Images Pushed Pull down the newly pushed images. docker-compose pull Follow the instructions within the docker-compose.yml file or within the Demo ISLE Installation to start up containers and install the Demo ISLE Installation ( https://isle.localdomain ). Ensure that all components, connections etc are working, otherwise troubleshoot as required, making the appropriate fixes to the associated Dockerfiles, pushing changes to the ISLE project git repository and then REPEATING this entire build and push process. Always test prior and post to ensure there are no issues pushed to end users.","title":"Build guide"},{"location":"contributor-docs/build-guide/#assumptions-prerequisites","text":"Laptop / workstation that conforms to the specifications outlined in the Hardware Requirements This image build site guide is designed for a local laptop / workstation that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the Demo ISLE Installation guide.

It is possible there will be more tags for different image versions in the future. For example if the installed proxy nginx software changes from 1.13 to 1.14 , change or add the new tag of 1.14 To learn more about tagging, read the official Docker tag documentation. To tag images: docker image ls ( to see the new IMAGE IDs ) docker tag IMAGE ID image/TAG IMAGE ID is the 12-character identification string for the image (listed from the Docker images command), and TAG is our newly created versioning tag.

Please proceed slowly. This Remote Server ISLE Installation creates an Islandora environment with a unique domain (URL) on your host server, virtual machine, or cloud hosted platform. You may also use this documentation to install ISLE on several host servers, virtual machines, or cloud hosted platforms to create multiple Islandora environments (e.g. development, staging, and production). This process will result in an un-themed Drupal website and an empty Fedora repository. (Please refer back to the Hardware Requirements as the development environment needs fewer resources than the staging and production environments; the latter two should mirror each other in resource usage and setup.) Please post questions to the public Islandora ISLE Google group , or subscribe to receive emails. The Glossary defines terms used in this documentation. Assumptions / Prerequisites You have already completed the Hardware Requirements and the Software Dependencies for your host server. SSL Certificates: You will either ask your IT department to provision SSL Certificates or you will use the Let's Encrypt: Free SSL Certificates to generate SSL certificates for the ISLE environment. Never ever share or post your .env files publicly. The .env and tomcat.env files (\"Docker Environment files\") are your primary resources for customizing your ISLE stack. These .env files contain passwords and usernames and must be treated with the utmost care. THIS SECTION IS IN DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE COME BACK SOON. Step 1: Setup GIT Workflow Create Two Private Institutional GIT Repositories Note: Since public forks can\u2019t be made private, we will duplicate (instead of forking) the repository to enable them to be private. Create a new PRIVATE repository on your institution's GitHub (or Bitbucket) account. Name it: [project-name]-ISLE (example: digital-ISLE ). Leave this repository empty. Create another new PRIVATE repository on your institution's GitHub (or Bitbucket) account. Name it: [project-name]-islandora (example: digital-islandora ). Leave this repository empty. Set your Remotes: Upstream and Origin Open a terminal and navigate to /opt/ISLE (or where you cloned the ISLE directory). Type git remote -v You want to have four lines returned, two that describe your private repository (called origin ) and two that describe the source ISLE github site (called upstream ): origin https://github.com/your-github-name/ISLE-Documentation.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/your-github-name/ISLE-Documentation.git (push) upstream https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git (push) If the name of the https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git is not upstream , then please correct that: Remove the non-upstream name: git remote rm non-upstream-name-here Rename it to be \"upstream\": git remote add upstream https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE Add your private insitutional repository as the remote origin . In the line below, substitute your-institution and \"project-name\", then enter it in your terminal. git remote add origin https://github.com/your-institution/project-name-ISLE Pull from the remote upstream master and update the remote origin master branch. Pull from upstream: git pull upstream master Git will ask you to authenicate with username and password: $> Username for 'https://github.com': your-github-name $> Password for 'https://your-github-name@github.com': xxxxx TODO: Lookup how to have your server remember your pwd and link to that here. TODO: Do you have 2-factor auth set up for github? No - okay, enter your github account username and pwd Yes - have to setup keys (link to how to do that..) Push to origin: git push -u origin master (-u is a one-time command that sets up tracking for branches) Done: You have now setup your server to consider ICG as upstream and \"[project-name]-ISLE\" as origin. General outline of Git Workflow: Work on local Pull from upstream master Push to origin master On development, staging, and production environments: pull from your single institutional git repository (e.g. williamscollege/unbound-ISLE) Step 2: Edit the Docker Environment Files The .env and tomcat.env Docker files are located in the folder with the docker-compose.yml, and are key to configuring the ISLE stack to suit your needs. Edit .env (found in root of ISLE directory). For example, a production server might be described as: COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle-production This variable is appended to Docker objects like volume and network names. BASE_DOMAIN=mydomain.edu This variable specifies your domain name. CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=ld Okay to leave this as is. Keep this variable short as it is appended to the end of all running containers. Edit tomcat.env (found in root of ISLE directory). For example, a production server might be described as: TOMCAT_ADMIN_USER=admin TOMCAT_ADMIN_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (enter a secure password) TOMCAT_MANAGER_USER=manager TOMCAT_MANAGER_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (enter a secure password) ISLE Environment Files - This page lists all the .env variables and corresponding user names and passwords used throughout the Islandora stack. Step 5: Edit File docker-compose.yml For Production and Staging Servers Only: Open the docker-compose.yml file and modify the environment variables called JAVA_MAX_MEM and JAVA_MIN_MEM for fedora, solr, and image-services. fedora: ... environment: - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M - JAVA_MIN_MEM=256M ... solr: ... environment: - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M - JAVA_MIN_MEM=256M ... image-services: ... environment: - JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M - JAVA_MIN_MEM=128M Step 7: Config Directory The ./ISLE/config/ directory, along with the proxy and ssl-certs subdirectories, store the customized configuration files necessary (i.e. proxy settings, SSL Certificate and Key) for the Traefik proxy to interact properly with your web domain (URL). The Docker environment file (.env) bind mounts these subdirectories to communicate with precise locations within the Docker containers. SSL Certificates A Remote Server ISLE Installation requires that you provision and place a complete SSL Certificate Chain into the ./ISLE/config/proxy/ssl-certs directory. These SSL certificates are used by the apache & proxy Docker containers. Generate SSL certificates by using ONE of the following two methods: Method 1: Ask your IT department to provision a complete SSL Certificate Chain . Copy these SSL certificates into the ./ISLE/config/proxy/ssl-certs directory. You are required to have exactly two files: (names will differ from examples) (1) SSL Certificate Key File (file extension may be: \".key\" or \".pem\") Example: sample-key.key or sample-key.pem (1) SSL Certificate File (file extension may be: \".cer\", \".crt\" or \".pem\") Example: sample.cer or sample.crt or sample.pem Edit the ./ISLE/config/proxy/traefik.toml file. Change lines 27 and 28: certFile = \"/certs/sample.cert\" ## Change to reflect your \".cer\", \".crt\" or \".pem\" keyFile = \"/certs/sample-key.key\" ## Change to reflect your \".key\" or \".pem\" Proceed to the section below: Step 9: Spin up ISLE Containers . Method 2: Use Let's Encrypt , a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority for generating SSL certificates for your ISLE environment. In order to get a certificate for your website\u2019s domain from Let\u2019s Encrypt, you have to demonstrate control over the domain. With Let\u2019s Encrypt, you do this using software that uses the ACME protocol, which typically runs on your web host. Complete the Let's Encrypt: Free SSL Certificates ISLE guide. Proceed to the section below: Step 9: Spin up ISLE Containers . Step 9: Spin up ISLE Containers Download and start all ISLE Docker images ( ~6 GB of data may take 5-10 minutes ): docker-compose up -d Wait for the stack to completely initialize. This process may take 10 - 20 minutes ( depending on system and internet speeds ) Run the install site script on the Apache container by copying and pasting this command: [TODO: A server install should not be told to run this script: we want the install to be persistent, not ephemeral.] docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh Check the newly created and running new site by opening a browser and navigating to your site domain e.g. https://project-name.yourdomain.edu , you should now see an un-themed Drupal site. (Good points for somewhere else:) ISLE removes the need to manually edit the more complex config files that are part of the Islandora stack. The ./ISLE/config/proxy/ssl-certs directory for a Demo ISLE Installation is what holds our proxy configs and is where we store our SSL Certificate and Key. Additional Resources TBD: Demo ISLE Installation: Resources contains Docker container passwords and URLs for administrator tools. TBD: Demo ISLE Installation: Troubleshooting contains help for port conflicts, non-running Docker containers, etc. End of Remote Server ISLE Installation.

Caution : While the ISLE Project recommends use of export methods or tools such as rsync, scp etc., it assumes that end users are familiar with them and are aware of possible dangers of improperly exporting or copying production data. Ensure adequate backups of any production system(s) are made prior to any attempts. If you are not familiar or are uncomfortable with these processes, it is highly advisable to work with an appropriate IT department. Finally also please note: Instructions from this checklist and the Migrate to ISLE Environment may call for you to COPY data from your running Islandora environment to a newly created folder: yourdomain-data on your ISLE Host Server or current_prod_islandora_config on your local machine. You will then work from these copies for future steps. In some cases, you'll need to copy configurations down to your machine and merge contents as directed. ( if necessary ) In other cases, due to the size of the data e.g. Fedora data you will copy production data to the ISLE Host server ( ISLE Host server ) instead of your local machine.

Please proceed slowly. This will help you migrate your existing production Islandora 7.x environment to an ISLE environment for easily maintaining Islandora. This documentation will help you identify and copy your institution's preexisting Islandora data, files, and themes (including your data volume, Drupal site(s) and theme(s), and commonly customized xml and xslt files) to your ISLE environment. Please post questions to the public Islandora ISLE Google group , or subscribe to receive emails. The Glossary defines terms used in this documentation. Assumptions / Prerequisites You have already completed the Hardware Requirements , Software Dependencies for your host server, and Remote Server ISLE Installation . Never ever share or post your .env files publicly. The .env and tomcat.env files (\"Docker Environment files\") are your primary resources for customizing your ISLE stack. These .env files contain passwords and usernames and must be treated with the utmost care. You have disk space on - or mounted to - the host server large enough to store a full copy of your fedora data store. You have sufficient storage available for the ISLE host server to accommodate a working copy of a production Islandora's associated configurations and data. THIS SECTION IS IN DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE COME BACK SOON. Migrate Only: Finding Usernames and Passwords You have usernames and passwords for key parts of your current Islandora production environment which will be used for the migration. The next steps will walk you through finding this information. Login to your current Islandora production server. If your current production environment is located across multiple servers, you may need to check more than one server to find this information. To find your Drupal MySQL username, password, and database run the following command: grep --include=filter-drupal.xml -rnw -e 'dbname.*user.*password.*\"' / 2>/dev/null Example output: connection server=\"localhost\" port=\"3306\" dbname=\"**islandora**\" user=\"**drupalIslandora**\" password=\"**Kjs8n5zQXfPNhZ9k**\" Username: copy the value from user= Password: copy the value from password= Database: copy the value from dbname= To find your Fedora MySQL username, password, and database run the following command: grep --include=fedora.fcfg -rnw -e 'name=\"dbUsername\"' -e 'name=\"dbPassword\"' -e 'name=\"jdbcURL\"' / 2>/dev/null This command will print multiple lines. The first three lines are important but please save the rest (just in case).

Login to your current Islandora production server. If your current production environment is located across multiple servers, you may need to check more than one server to located these data folders. Finding your Fedora data folder (common locations include /usr/local/fedora/data or /usr/local/tomcat/fedora/data ): Run a find command: find / -type d -ipath '*fedora/data' -ls 2>/dev/null Finding your Drupal data folder (common location is under /var/www/ likely in a sub-folder; e.g., html, islandora, etc.) Run a grep command: grep --include=index.php -rl -e 'Drupal' / 2>/dev/null Finding your Solr data folder (common location: /usr/local/solr , /usr/local/tomcat/solr , or /usr/local/fedora/solr ) Run a find command: find / -type d -ipath '*solr/*/data' -ls 2>/dev/null Finding your FedoraGSearch data (i.e. transforms) folder Run a find command: find / -type d -ipath '*web-inf/classes/fgsconfigfinal' -ls 2>/dev/null You have a SQL dump (export) of the current production site's Drupal database. Ensure that the contents of any cache table are not exported. Login to your current Islandora production server and navigate to your Drupal data folder. Run the following command to generate a SQL dump of your Drupal database: mysqldump -u {DRUPAL_USERNAME} -p {DRUPAL_DATABASE_NAME} | gzip > drupal.sql.gz Finally also please note: Instructions from this guide and it's associated checklists call for you to COPY data from your current production Islandora environment to your ISLE Host Server or local computer. You work from these copies to build your ISLE environment. In some cases, you'll need to copy configurations down to your local computer ( Local ISLE config laptop ) and merge contents as directed. In other cases, due to the size of the data e.g. Fedora data you will copy directly to the ISLE Host server ( Remote ISLE Host server ). You will note where you have stored copies of files/data in a docker-compose.yml file. You will store your configured files in a git repository and use that to deploy to the ISLE host server. Create Data Storage Directory This area will be where all current Islandora production data is to be stored. This includes the Apache /var/www/html directory and the appropriate Fedora /usr/local/fedora/data subdirectories outlined below. ON your ISLE Host server: Create a directory named yourdomain-data (where \"yourdomain\" is your server domain name) Example: project-name.yourdomain.edu-data Ensure that the islandora user has ownership and permissions to access this data. chown -Rv islandora:islandora ~/project-name.yourdomain.edu-data Please note this path may change depending on how your ISLE host server storage area is setup. Migration Export Checklist In the /opt/ISLE/yourdoman-config directory create a new sub-directory (you can call this current_prod_islandora_config ) You will copy some files from your current Islandora Production server(s) into this directory following the Migration Export Checklist and you will copy some files and folders directly to your ISLE host server (in case the data involved is too large for your local workstation) as directed in the checklist. Noting most likely the Apache data ( /var/www/html ) & Fedora data ( /usr/local/fedora/data ) will be moved directly to your ISLE host server storage area and your new ISLE config files will be built on your local machine in the current_prod_islandora_config folder you just created. These copied files will be the source for edits and merges - just to be very clear, please don't work directly on these files in your currently running production Islandora system! To be even more clear, after following the checklist, you should now have two nearly identical /config subdirectories A. copied from the cloned ISLE repository and renamed with your domain e.g. yourdomain-config or project-name.yourdomain.edu-config B. copied from your currently running Islandora environment. e.g. current_prod_islandora_config Migration Merge Checklist The goal is to merge all site-specific data (domain names, variables, usernames, passwords, etc..) AND all site-specific customizations or settings from the files in directory B. into the matching files in directory A. Compare the data and settings of the files found within directory B. current_prod_islandora_config , and then merge, edit or copy as necessary with the templated settings found within the renamed directory A. yourdomain-config as guided in the Migration Merge Checklist . Customizations: ( optional ) Carefully compare the following most frequently customized files with the new, default versions found within your new ISLE config folder. Use a \"Diff\" tool (example: Beyond Compare to merge any desired customizations from your production Islandora files to persist within the new ISLE config folder of files: Compare and merge the Solr files: schema.xml Compare and merge the Solr files: solrconfig.xml Compare and merge the Solr files: stopwords Compare and merge the Fedora GSearch Islandora Transform (XSLTs) folder of files: islandora_transforms Final Steps Now that all the changes are made (be sure to save), ISLE should be ready to test. First you'll need to push these changes to your private code repository. Open a terminal - cd to the config directory you've been making the changes in... git status this will show you all the files that have been modified and ready to be added to your private repository along with handy paths for the next steps. git add /pathtoyourmodifiedfile (replace \"pathtoyourmodifiedfile\" with the path to your config directory) run these: git add apache git add fedora git add mysql git add proxy git add solr git add docker-compose.yml run git status again - everything should be in green now as all modified files have been added - if anything's still red use git add and the path to add it then run git commit -m \"initial config commit\" inside the double quotes is the commit message you can say whatever you want in this message - so for example if this is the config for your dev instance you could say that... run git push origin master this will push all your changes to the repository further changes should be made on branches for different servers or to master branch for this same server Clone Custom Configuration to Host Server Open a terminal - ssh into your host server using the islandora user cd to /opt/ISLE/config/ because your customizations are in a private repository, you'll need to add this islandora user's id_rsa.pub key to the repository via the website. This key is found in /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub One can simply run cat /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy the output (ensure no whitespaces or extra returns) Go to the repository web site with a browser and locate your private repository. locate the ssh key entry location (in Bitbucket this is in Settings / Access Keys / add an ssh key w/ the label islandora host server paste in the key text and click Add Key Back at your terminal command line, run git clone URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo.git . (replacing \"URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo\" with the URL to the repository provided by the website) cd into the newly cloned directory - this is a good time to check that the ISLE directory contains your yourdomain-config directory and that it reflects all the edits and customizations. Spin up ISLE Containers Review or Pull Down ISLE Docker Images Please Note: You may have already done this in setting up the host server manually and / or with Ansible. However it is always a good idea to review and check using the first command below. Check if all ISLE images have been downloaded docker image ls If yes, then proceed to Step 7 If not, then pull the latest images: docker-compose pull Spin Up the Proxy Container ======= cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d proxy Spin up the MySQL Container and Import Production Database(s) cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d mysql Two methods for connecting to the MySQL Database (GUI / CLI) pick one. One may use SQL GUI clients e.g. Sequel Pro, Navicat, PHPMyAdmin etc. and import the production Drupal website database(s) If the above not practical, one may connect to the MySQL container and run the following. docker exec -it isle-mysql-institution bash to connect to the container swap out institution for the correct container name. appropriate mysql commands here: consult MySQL documentation - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/ 2a. ( optional ) Only follow this if you have not first run drush cc all and then exported the MySQL databases or if you have not exported the MySQL databases excluding the contents of any table with cache in the name. The following are STEPS, not literal commands to prepare your db for ISLE ( doing this because we've found there are errors using exported db from production because of caches - causes problems - steps below help you remove this problem ) import the production databases into the isle-mysql-institution container ( with errors being ignored ) truncate all tables that start with cache on the isle-mysql-institution container export this new database to the mysql directory on the isle host server delete all tables ( not the database itself ) on the isle-mysql-institution container Re-import the new lighter database to the isle-mysql container Spin up the Fedora Container and Start the Reindex Processes Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d fedora * optional check if fedora is running properly e.g. http://isle-prod-project.institution:8080/manager/html docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash Follow the steps outlined in the Migration Reindex Process Guide Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex Fedora RI (1 of 3) section Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex SQL database (2 of 3) section Pause here before attempting the steps within the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section. Move onto the next section in this guide, Spin up apache container . Spin up Apache Container Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d apache docker exec -it isle-apache-institution bash Run the vset script cd /var/www/html ./vsets.sh Edit .htaccess to enforce https echo \"SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-Proto https HTTPS=on\" | tee -a /var/www/html/.htaccess Check if the site is now is running properly by opening a web browser and navigating to your new ISLE domain e.g. https://isle-prod-project.institution Please note while you may be able to see objects being displayed, metadata and search results will be empty until you run the last step in the Reindex process. Troubleshooting Note Sites migrating from a version of Drupal prior to 7.50 may need to update their mysql tables to utf8mb4. On the new site, go to https://isle-prod-project.institution/admin/reports/status (you will need to be logged in as a Drupal Admin) and look for the following error: Instructions for converting the Drupal mysql database are available on the Drupal website Spin Up Solr Container and Complete the Reindex Processes ======= Staying within /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config docker-compose up -d solr ( optional ) check if solr is running properly e.g. http://isle-prod-project.institution:8777/manager/html docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash NOTE FEDORA NOT SOLR! Follow the steps outlined in the Migration Reindex Process Guide Follow the steps outlined only in the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section.

The suggested workflow is for endusers to review the Production file(s) first, make note of any settings and then make appropriate edits within the yourdomain-config directory to change values, add passwords or usernames etc on your local laptop with the ultimate goal of checking all results into a git repository for deploy later on the ISLE Host server. The only change is that unless otherwise directed e.g. Apache html and Fedora data . all changes should be made on the local laptop in the yourdomain-config directory. Please note as per the migration guide instructions the name of this directory shouldn't literally be \"yourdomain-config\" or \"yourdomain-data\" so replace \"yourdomain\" with the name of your intended Islandora site's domain. While this checklist will attempt to point out most of the merge challenges or pitfalls, you may encounter unique situations depending on the edits and customizations made to your Islandora environment in the past. This is a good place to reach out to the Islandora community for assistance. Please note: In some cases, some of the configuration files copied from your running production Islandora may have comments (#) in them to help guide endusers to make the appropriate edits e.g. (# end user edit here) In most cases, many of the configuration files copied from ISLE repository to yourdomain-config will have fake or empty settings in them.

Each subdirectory is grouped by the image / container software type and each contains a respective Dockerfile. apache fedora mysql proxy solr \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 ansible \u251c\u2500\u2500 apache \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 config \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 isle-sample \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose-build.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 fedora \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 proxy \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 solr \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile | \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u2514\u2500\u2500 vagrant Dockerfile Conventions Making changes within these files will alter the contents and functionality of the ISLE images. Ensure that each Dockerfile does not have a file suffix or extension. Each command needs to be terminated with a \\ unless it is the final command. Each new command or action added will increase the size of the image once built. Attempt to balance size with functionality. All ISLE images use official Docker build images. Review the Docker Containers & Images Specifications Page for a listing of those builds. Dockerfile Composition Following standard Docker convention , all ISLE Dockerfiles have similar structures. Examples displayed are from the Apache Dockerfile FROM command indicating which official Docker image is used as the base build. The Apache image uses two base images to first compile ffmpeg and ghostscript and then copying the resulting binaries and libraries to a new clean base image so that the development tools are not installed on the final image. Reduces size. FROM ubuntu:14.04 AS ffmpeg_base is the first base image used. FROM ubuntu:14.04 is the second base image used. LABEL - For ISLE Committers to version control image descriptions, functionality and additional meta-data. ( optional ) RUN - Execute commands e.g. RUN apt-get update etc. COPY - Within each ISLE image directory there are additional files or subdirectories are copied from the local laptop to the image itself. e.g. COPY envinit.sh /opt/adore-djatoka-1.1/bin/envinit.sh ENV - sets any environmental variables necessary for software to run or be configured properly. ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle \\ JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre \\ PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin \\ KAKADU_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/adore-djatoka-1.1/lib/Linux-x86-64 \\ KAKADU_HOME=/opt/adore-djatoka-1.1/lib/Linux-x86-64 VOLUME - Exposes a volume for data necessary for the build to continue. e.g. VOLUME /var/www/html EXPOSE - Opens up ports (80,443) on the temporary build containers created and to persist in further usage. Can be overridden by any docker-compose.yml file ENTRYPOINT - Allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. Within the apache Dockerfile , the server is told to \"run\" using the apache2ctl utility by this last line: ENTRYPOINT [\"/usr/sbin/apache2ctl\", \"-D\", \"FOREGROUND\"] Dockerfile Commenting For ISLE Contributors when possible it is highly recommended that all sections be commented appropriately to explain functionality or actions to all Developers looking to customize or curious end users.
